This file has two parts.  The first part describes the debug_level
definitions that were in the old code and which files they were in.
The second part describes the new structure for debug levels.
The debug level structure was modified in February of 2002 by KB6MER.
Questions/comments/flames can be sent to kb6mer@arrl.net

Places where debug level is referenced in old code, and the levels
referenced (if debug_level xx), where xx is >0, &1, etc.

alert.c >0
bulletin_gui.c &1
db.c >=2 &1 &128 &32 &256 ()
gps.c &128
hostname.c &256
igate.c &2
interface.c &128 &2 &1
interface_gui.c &128
lang.c &32
main.c &4 <0/>255(need to change limits) &8 &128 &1 &15
maps.c &16 &2 >=2 &4 &1 &8
messages.c >1 &1 >5
messages_gui.c &2
track_gui.c >=2
util.c &1
wx.c >2 &1
xa_config.c &1 &2

Here's how things are after KB6MER tweaked it all...

New Scheme
1       General basic debugging (any system)
2       Messages, WX, Objects, and Items, Port Data Flow
4       X Object Debugging
8       X Window Object Debugging
16      Map Debugging (maps.c)
32      Language Debugging (maps.c)
64      Database Object Debugging
128     GPS Interface Detailed debugging
256     station and trail display detailed debugging
512     Map import/export function debugging
1024    Internet Transaction debugging

2048    Levels 2048 and above will require modification to the
        main.c file to change the bounds checking, and are
        available for future use.
