Previous Install Notes:
-----------------------
     Backup all previous installed data!

  Xastir 0.1.0 users (if there are any of you still around!):

     For Xastir version 0.1.0 and below there are new file locations:
     All map data, tnc config data, and support files now go under the
     /usr/local/xastir directory. All personal config data, logs, etc are
     user the (user home dir)/.xastir directory (which will be created after
     xastir starts). You can copy (after your first xastir startup) your
     xastir.cnf file to your (user home dir)/.xastir/config directory. MAKE
     SURE YOU DELETE all lines referencing Files! Xastir may not run properly
     if you don't!

     If you have Xastir version 0.1.1 then your files are in the right place,
     just follow the typical build instructions.

  Xastir 0.2.0 users:

     Xastir 0.2.0 and newer have new device controls so you will need to
     setup your devices again with 0.2.0.
     Look at File->Configure->Interfaces and File->Configure->Defaults

  Xastir 0.3.x, 0.9.x, 1.0.x, 1.1.0:

     Versions above 1.1 drop privileges if they are run as root. If any of the
     Xastir files are owned by root, on only readable by root, they will cause
     problems. Fix these files by "chmod 644 filename" where filename is the
     problem file.
