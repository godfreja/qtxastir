Installing Xastir on Windows/Cygwin:
------------------------------------

Please Note:  It's beneficial to actually log in to your Windows box
rather than skipping that step of the Windows login process (Don't
hit escape just to get rid of the dialog!).  If you log into Windows
properly, Cygwin will be able to figure out where to put your home
directory.  If you don't do this, you'll be referred to as "unknown"
and you won't have a home directory in Cygwin.  This means there
won't be a good place to put your Xastir startup files.  Of course,
log in as the same user each time in order for Cygwin to use the
proper home directory for you.

Explanation of this login box, for those that don't see it:  If you have
the option of running networking, you'll have a login box show up when you
first start up Windows.  It'll ask for you user name and password, then let
you in.  If you escape out of that dialog, Windows may start right up but
networking will be disabled.

If you don't see that box, there are two options that I know about, either
you or someone else set it up to auto-login with your user/password combo,
or you don't have networking installed at all.

The following steps direct you through installing Cygwin, Xastir,
and a few optional map libraries that Xastir can use.  Note that in
most of the places below where the directions state to type
commands, this must be done from within a Cygwin bash shell, not a
DOS window.


Step 1)  Install Cygwin, a free download.


Step 1a) Go to http://www.cygwin.com with your web browser.  Look
for the black and green Cygwin icon, then click on "Install now!".
This will load the Cygwin network installer program onto your
computer.  Remember where you install this program.  I put mine in
"c:\<login>\cygwin\setup.exe", for instance
"c:\hacker\cygwin\setup.exe".


Step 1b)  Find the "setup.exe" program and execute it either by:

  a) Clicking on it with File Explorer, or
  b) Start->Run->path to executable, or
  c) Opening a DOS window and typing the name.

This will start installing Cygwin over the network.  Answers to
provide to the program:

    Install from Internet (*)
    "C:\cygwin"
    Install For All Users
    Default Text File Type Unix (*)
    Local Package Directory "C:\hacker\cygwin"
    Select Your Internet Connection (choose one)
    Choose A Download Site (choose one near you if possible)

Note:  Responses above listed with a "(*)" are required.  Others are
up to the individual user to answer as they wish.  You'll get to a
"Progress" page where "setup.bz2" is downloaded from the 'net.  If
it hangs at this step, you may wish to "Cancel" and try another
server until you obtain this file and are presented with a list of
packages to install.


Step 1c)  Select Packages: Select the default Cygwin packages _plus_
the packages listed below.  Note that enabling some of these
packages causes others to be selected as well, that's ok and
necessary:

    devel/autoconf
    devel/automake
    devel/binutils
    devel/cvs
    devel/gcc
    devel/make
    devel/rcs
    editors/vim
    graphics/tiff (install sources for this one too? TBD)
    interpreters/m4
    interpreters/perl
    text/less
    utils/diff
    utils/patch
    web/wget
    XFree86/fvwm
    XFree86/lesstif
    XFree86/XFree86-prog


Step 1d)  Click Next and the packages will get downloaded/installed.
Repeat the above if you have network difficulties, until the install
succeeds.


Step 1e)  At the end of the install it'll ask you if you wish to
create desktop links.  Select these items to create an icon
(Black/Green Cygwin icon) and a menu entry.  Click "Finish".  Cygwin
is now installed.


Step 2)  Create an X-Windows icon on the desktop and the startup
file to go with it.

Copy "C:\cygwin\usr\X11r6\bin\startxwin.bat" to (same path)
"C:\cygwin\usr\X11r6\bin\startxwin.fvwm2.bat".  Edit this new file,
changing all instances of "twm" to "fvwm2".  Make a shortcut on your
desktop that points to this file, and rename the shortcut
"X-Windows" or similar.  You may be able to find a large red X in
the system32\moricons.dll file if you wish to change the icon
(depending on which Windows version you're running).


Step 3)  Test the two icons.

Double-click on the green/black cygwin icon.  You should get a shell
window that looks very much like a DOS window.  Type "exit" and then
press <Enter> to make it disappear.

Double-click on the "X-Windows" icon.  You should get a large window
with a smaller shell window displayed on it.  If you right-click on
the background, you should get a menu.  Select "Exit FVWM" to make
the large window go away, or click on the "X" in the corner of the
window.


Step 4)  Create a file at C:\cygwin\home\<user>\ called ".cvsrc",
where the "<user>" part is your Windows login name.  For instance, I
created a file:  "C:\cygwin\home\hacker\.cvsrc".  The file should
contain the following lines:

    cvs -z3
    update -P -d
    status -v


Step 5)  Download Xastir sources.  Start up a Cygwin shell
(black/green icon).  Type the commands below into the shell exactly.
Hit <ENTER> when asked for a password:

    cd ~
    mkdir src
    cd src
    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xastir login 
    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xastir co xastir 

If you keep seeing "EOF" at the end of a short error message, it
means that the anonymous CVS server at SourceForge is overloaded.
Keep trying!

The end result when it succeeds  will be a new directory
"C:\cygwin\home\<user>\src\xastir\" which contains the full Xastir
source code.

Side Note:  Here's the coolest thing about CVS:  Once you've done
this initial source-code download, you'll never have to do the whole
Xastir download again.  You'll just go into the "src/xastir"
directory and type "cvs update", which will snag just the _changes_
to the files since you last updated, and is very fast.  Compile and
install at that point and you'll be running the latest developer's
version in just a few minutes!  It's easy to keep up with the
developers this way.


Step 6)  Configure/compile/install Xastir.  Type these commands into
the Cygwin shell, waiting until each one completes before typing the
next command:

    cd ~/src/xastir
    ./bootstrap.sh
    ./configure
    make
    make install

Ignore the "PACKAGE_* redefined" warnings.  They won't break
anything and are just an annoyance.

Once you get through the above commands, Xastir is compiled and
installed on your system, with minimal map support.  Later sections
of this document detail adding additional map libraries in order to
give you access to the full mapping capability of Xastir.


Step 7)  Create a link to the Xastir executable.  Type the following
commands in the Cygwin shell:

    cd ~
    ln -s /usr/local/bin/xastir xastir

That will create a symbolic link from your home directory to the
Xastir executable, to make it easier to run Xastir without typing a
long path each time.


Step 8)  Run Xastir:  Start X-Windows using the desktop icon you
created before.  From the "xterm" window displayed, type "xastir &"
or "/usr/local/bin/xastir &".  Xastir should start.

Note:  Xastir has support for pocketAPRS, dosAPRS, WinAPRS, MacAPRS
and GNIS maps by default.  For additional types of maps, you'll need
to install some libraries, then recompile Xastir so that it knows to
use them.  See the instructions below.

The README.1ST file has instructions for where to get maps and where
to put them under the Xastir heirarchy. 

What Xastir paths look like from within Windows (in case you're
moving maps around with Explorer):  Just prefix them all with
"cygwin/".  For instance, maps go into /cygwin/usr/local/xastir/maps
instead of /usr/local/xastir/maps.  Xastir will continue to see them
as "/usr/local/xastir/maps" though from inside Cygwin.  It kind of
looks like a miniature Unix box from inside Cygwin.

Run Windows in 15-bit color or better (32768 colors or more) or
you'll get lots of warnings about Xastir not being able to allocate
colors when it starts up, and the display will be rather stark
looking.

To set a new language or change the language current choice, use
this command line instead from inside an Xterm:

     xastir -l <language>

Current choices are: English Dutch French German Italian Portuguese
Spanish

This option will be stored in the users config file for the next
time Xastir is run. On new installs Xastir will default to English
unless you use this command line option.

Another difference with Cygwin as opposed to Unix-like operating
systems:  You can't do the make install portion if Xastir is up and
running.  You have to kill Xastir first before you do "make install"
or "make install-strip".

Note that one user running Cygwin on XP had it crash every time his
screensaver kicked in.  Disabling the screenserver fixed that
problem.

Please see the README.1ST file and the Help menu in Xastir itself
for additional information not mentioned in this document.



-------------------------------------------
OPTIONAL:  ADDING ADDITIONAL MAP LIBRARIES:
-------------------------------------------

These additional Xastir libraries have been tested on Cygwin:

    ImageMagick
    Shapelib
    libtiff
    libproj
    libgeotiff

Anyone testing additional libraries is encouraged to share their
findings on the Xastir mailing lists.



RECOMMENDED:  Adding Shapelib (tested with shapelib-1.2.9):
-----------------------------------------------------------
Allows using many sources of online polygon, polyline, and point
maps, including ones from NOAA.  This is the only format used for
weather alert maps.

From a Cygwin bash shell, type:

    cd ~/src
    mkdir shapelib
    
Fetch "shapelib-1.2.9.tar.gz" from here:

    http://gdal.velocet.ca/projects/shapelib/index.html

Put it in the C:\cygwin\home\<user>\shapelib directory.  Untar it
from the Cygwin shell window:

    cd ~/src/shapelib
    tar xzvf shapelib-1.2.9.tar.gz

1) Edit Shapelib's Makefile to remove the space after the "-h"
on the line that starts like this:

    /usr/bin/ld -G -h libshp.so.1 ...

then type:

    cd ~/src/shapelib/shapelib-1.2.9
    make lib
    make lib_install

You may get the "undefined reference impure_ptr" messages.  If so,
edit the file /usr/include/sys/reent.h to remove the word "extern"
from this line:

    extern struct _reent *_impure_ptr __ATTRIBUTE_IMPURE_PTR__;

then try "make lib" and make "lib_install" again.

Edit or create your .profile file in your home directory.  It
appears that Cygwin uses the PATH variable to look for both binaries
and libraries.  Add this line to the file (create the "~/.profile"
file if the file doesn't exist):

    export PATH=$PATH:/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/X11R6/lib:/usr/local/lib

Now you should be ready to configure and compile Xastir with
Shapelib support.  Type these commands:

    cd ~/src/xastir
    ./configure
    make
    make install

The installed copy of Xastir should now have Shapelib support.  You
can download NOAA weather alert maps and many other sorts of maps,
and Xastir will recognize and use them.  Note that weather alert
shapefiles must go into the /usr/local/xastir/Counties directory.
See the README.1ST file for where to get the maps.



OPTIONAL:  Adding ImageMagick (tested with ImageMagick 5.5.3):
--------------------------------------------------------------
Allows using more than 68 different graphics format files as maps,
by creating an associated .geo file for each with tiepoints.  This
support also allows use of online Tiger and Terraserver maps with
Xastir, and NOAA weather radar images.  Other people are working on
integrating even more online mapping sources.  This will also allow
you to use any GIF/JPG/XPM/BMP/... image as an Xastir map.

ImageMagick:
        http://www.imagemagick.org/

    cd ~/src
    mkdir imagemagick

Download the ImageMagick cygwin binary from www.imagemagick.org or
one of it's mirrors.  Put it in the ~/src/imagemagick directory.
Extract the files:

    cd ~/src/imagemagick
    tar xzvf filename

Copy the files/directories into the /usr tree (/usr/include and /usr/lib).

    cd ~/src/xastir
    ./configure
    make
    make install

Add this to your ~/.profile file:

    export MAGICK_HOME=/usr

Now on-line Tigermaps should work for you.

If you create a file called "terraserver.geo" in the
/usr/local/xastir/maps directory, containing the single line
"TERRASERVER", and select it with the Map Chooser, you should see
satellite images on the map screen.

Once I start up X-windows, I have to type this in a shell and start
Xastir from that shell in order to make all of the paths known:

    cd
    . ./.profile

So it appears that starting up X-windows using the startxwin.bat
script ends up putting you somewhere other than your home directory,
and your .profile doesn't end up getting sourced.  There must be a
better way.



OPTIONAL:  Install geoTIFF support:
-----------------------------------
Allows using USGS DRG topo maps or other types of geoTIFF
maps/images and has the ability to tile smaller maps into a larger
contiguous map of an area:

For geoTIFF support (such as USGS DRG topo maps) you need:
    libproj:
        http://www.remotesensing.org/proj/
     and for datum translations:
        ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/proj/proj-nad27-1.1.tar.gz
    libgeotiff:
        http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/geotiff.html
        ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/geotiff/libgeotiff/libgeotiff-1.1.5.tar.gz

    Please note that the order of installation for these libraries is
    critical.  Follow the instructions below carefully.



Adding libproj to Cygwin (tested with proj-4.4.6):
--------------------------------------------------

NOTE: You must install libproj BEFORE compiling libgeotiff, because
libgeotiff uses libproj to do the datum translations. If you install
libgeotiff first, datum translations won't work.

The proj-nad27-1.1.tar.gz must be decompressed in the nad
subdirectory of the proj distribution directory before you run
configure.
    
    cd ~/src/libproj    
    tar xzvf proj-4.4.6.tar.gz
    cd proj-4.4.6/nad
    tar xzvf ../../proj-nad27-1.1.tar.gz
    cd ..
    ./configure
    make
    make install



Adding libgeotiff (tested with libgeotiff-1.2.0):
-------------------------------------------------

    tar xzvf libgeotiff-1.2.0.tar.gz
    cd libgeotiff-1.2.0
    ./configure
    make
    make install

If you must re-run "configure" for any of these libraries, remember
to delete "config.status" and "config.cache" files first.

You may get the "undefined reference impure_ptr" messages (just like
with Shapelib above).  If so, edit the file /usr/include/sys/reent.h
to remove the word "extern" from this line:

    extern struct _reent *_impure_ptr __ATTRIBUTE_IMPURE_PTR__;

then try "make" and "make install" again.

I've had it compile all the way through, but I've also had it bomb
out when it gets to the "ld -shared" step.  At that point it writes
a lot of "undefined reference" messages.  The line at which the
compile might fail:


    ld -shared xtiff.o geo_free.o geo_get.o geo_names.o geo_new.o
    geo_print.o geo_set.o geo_tiffp.o geo_write.o geo_trans.o
    geo_normalize.o geotiff_proj4.o geo_extra.o cpl_serv.o cpl_csv.o -lproj
    -ltiff -ljpeg -lz -lm -L/usr/local/lib -o libgeotiff.so.1.1.5


To fix this, edit the Makefile to add "-lc" to the end of the LIBS
line and run "make" again, then "make install".

Set up Xastir to use the new geotiff libraries:

    cd ~/src/xastir
    ./configure
    make
    make install

It should find libtiff/libproj/libgeotiff at the configure stage and
compile in support for geotiff maps.  You should now be able to use
USGS geoTIFF topo maps, and see them tiled together in the map
window into a continuous map.
