HELP-INDEX>Welcome! and Notes from the Author

                               Welcome to XASTIR!

XASTIR, Stands for, X-windows Amateur Station Tracking and Information Reporting.

It is an APRS(tm) like program that is Open Source and free to use and pass out
to others. Currently this program is in development and should not be seen as 
a finished product! Your help will be needed to make this a better program.  If 
you have programming skills and/or can write documentation, your help may be 
needed! I have a lot of ideas but very little time. So if you think you can add
something to the effort let us know!


APRS[tm] is a Trademark of Bob Bruninga, 
his home page is at "http://web.usna.navy.mil/~bruninga/aprs.html"
HELP-INDEX>Getting Started

                               Getting Started

Now that you have XASTIR running you must configure it!

Xastir will by default not transmit any data. By default most options are
turned off It will not even open the port to your TNC or GPS until you tell
it. So go through the configuration Help section to configure XASTIR for 
your station.

NOTE: On menus, items that are grayed out are selected, as in the on/off 
options, if the on is selected it will be grayed out.

HELP-INDEX>Configuring the Defaults

                             Configuring the Defaults

Click on Configure then on Defaults.

Select the time that must pass, from the last time a station is heard, for
that station to be considered old. Default is 2 hours. This means if you
hear from a station at say 2 PM and that station is not heard from after 2
hours, the stations icon on the screen will look ghosted or transparent.

Clicking OK will save your changes, Clicking on Cancel will keep the current
settings.

HELP-INDEX>Configuring the GPS/Port

                               Configuring the GPS/Port

Click on Configure then GPS/Port.

To use a stand alone GPS on the serial port, click on Stand alone GPS.
This port can be specified in the "Stand Alone GPS port" field. You may use
a serial device like /dev/ttyS1.

If you have a HSP cable, which allows you to share the tnc port with a GPS
unit you may select TNC Connect GPS (HSP Cable). This is a special cable and
my not work on all computers/GPS/TNC combinations.

Now you may select a GPS sample and TNC transmit rate, Remember use caution
here be friendly to your near by stations.

To activate the use of the GPS data select the "Use GPS Position?" option.
With this selection made the GPS unit will update your position. If this is 
not selected the current location will come from the location in Station 
information configuration. When active the GPS data will also update the 
location in Station information configuration.

When using the GPS your packets change, you will become a mobile station with
course and speed even if your not moving (I may change this to an option later).
The GPS time will allow you to select sample rates for the GPS and will override
the standard packet time for transmitting your station. If you are stationary
then use 10 minutes. If your doing something special/tracking etc.. use the
selection that will best fit the data you need. Please don't over transmit,
if you don't need to. 


Clicking OK will save your changes, Clicking on Cancel will keep the current
settings.

HELP-INDEX>Configuring the TNC/Port

                               Configuring the TNC/Port


Click on the Configure then TNC/Port

If you have a TNC and plan to use it with XASTIR select "Use TNC?". The 
default is, not selected.

Now enter the port the TNC is on i.e. /dev/ttyS0 for com1

Select the port settings that match your TNCs Baud Rate.

Enter in up to three UNPROTO paths.

Xastir will assume the XX VIA part of the UNPROTO path. There are three Paths 
allowed so that your signal will be heard if conditions are bad. If any of 
these are filled in XASTIR will cycle through one of them at each transmission
time. If you are local, just a WIDE2-2 may be a good choice. If you are using
low power and/or are distant from a digi then WIDE1-1,WIDE2-2 may work better.
Or if you know the call of your closest digi you may use XXXCALL,WIDE2-2. Most
of you will only need one path. If you are in a remote area and your signal is
difficult to get out you may need more. Check with a local group and ask what
path may be best for your area.

Clicking OK will save your changes, Clicking on Cancel will keep the current
settings.

HELP-INDEX>Configuring the Station information

                            Configuring the Station information


Enter your Call sign/SSID.

Default is N0CALL, if you don't know what this is perhaps you shouldn't be 
using this program. 

Next enter the Latitude in degrees, minutes.100ths of minutes and N for North
or S for South (Hemisphere).

Now enter the longitude also in degrees, minutes.100ths of minutes and E for
East and W for West. 

By default you are at 00 00.00N Lat, 000 00.00W long, or somewhere off the 
African cost.

Now enter the Group/overlay and the symbol of your station. Check the chart 
listing for what symbol to use. By default the symbol is x or for 
xwindows/unix and the group is "/". if you want to overlay a number/letter
on top of a symbol, enter the letter or digit in the group/overlay box and
pick a symbol form the "\" group. 

Next enter the data for the power/height/gain of your station. This is good
information to add but it is not required. These fields are broken in to
a granular representation of your station. For power choose the digit closest
to your power level form this chart.

Digit to use      0  1  2  3   4   5   6   7   8   9 
Power in (watts)  0  1  4  9  16  25  36  49  64  81
i.e if your running 36 watts use a "6".

The same for height, but this is not the height above the ground but rather
above the average terrain.

Digit to use   0   1   2   3    4    5    6     7     8     9 
Height        10  20  40  80  160  320  640  1280  2560  5120
i.e if your height is 1280 watts use a "7".

For Gain use the digit that is the gain of your antenna, in dB.

Direction needs another chart, the direction is degrees from North.

Digit to use    0   1   2    3    4    5    6    7    8     9 
Direction (deg) 0  45  90  135  180  225  270  315  360  None
i.e if your antenna is not directional use 0".

Enter a comment, not required but it will add insight on your station.

Position ambiguity will allow you control how accurate you  transmit your 
position. A setting of none will allow your station to transmit the exact 
position you have entered or received from a GPS. The other choices will
place you somewhere in the range of the choice you selected. 

Clicking OK will save your changes, Clicking on Cancel will keep the current
settings.

HELP-INDEX>Configuring the Internet connection

                            Configuring the Internet connection


To configure the Internet you will need to know of a host and a port number.
The default host is first.aprs.net and the post is 23. You can choose
others but this should work. A valid pass code will allow your station to
transmit thru the Internet. It will allow your station to come out of an 
I-gate and get retransmitted via RF. To get a pass code you will need to 
contact Steve Dimse, K4HG at www.aprs.net, Send him your name, call sign, etc.
Once he verifies your status as a HAM he can send you your code. You may still
receive and transmit data via the Internet even though you don't have a pass
code. But with out the pass code your data will not be retransmitted via RF.
Any one directly connected to the Internet will still get your message.

Host1 and Host2 are optional hosts that will be contacted if the primary host
is down. Each host will be tried twice, moving on to the next if the 
connection fails.

If you want XASTIR to reconnect after a net connection was dropped then
select "Reconnect on NET failure?" option which is on by default.

The last options are for setting up your station to be an Igate. This allows 
your station with your pass code to act just like a gate, but instead of 
another band your data will pass through the Internet. This option must not 
be taken lightly. First you must coordinate with others in your area so that 
you may truly add information that may be missing. You should also contact 
Steve about this. This version can send information received from your TNC to
the Internet and will broadcast any Internet message data through your station
via RF. It will only send data via RF if you have the Broadcast messages option
selected. Only stations that you have heard (via RF) in the last hour will
have messages sent to them in this way. Note also you are responsible for the
data transmitted by your station so be careful with this option (others may send
messages you do not want to transmit).

If you want to see what your I-Gate is doing turn on the Log I-gate 
transactions option. this will build a igate.log file in your "logs" directory
it will show all the data passed from local RF to the net with line that have
"IGATE-RF->NET:" and contain the full data. It will also show all the traffic
coming from the net with "NET->RF-IGATE:". Note here you will not see the full
outgoing packet, as your station and path are assumed. It will just show the
data as a 3rd party message.


Clicking OK will save your changes, Clicking on Cancel will keep the current
settings.

HELP-INDEX>Configuring Audio Alarms

                         Configuring Audio Alarms

To use this option you must have a sound card and a program that will play
wav files. The Audio Play Command should contain the program you want to
execute to play the audio file (and any command line options).

The fields will contain the name of the file to play, fields under the 
option will set parameters for the option.
  
The Current choices are:

  Play message on finding a new station. 

  Play message on receiving an new message.

  Play message on receiving data from a station within the min/max distance
    of your proximity settings.

  Play message on receiving data from a station (via TNC) with in the min/max
    distance of your band opening settings.

HELP-INDEX>Configuring Units

                         Configuring default Units


Units (English/Metric)
 This selects what units the data will displayed in. Metric is the default,
however English units are also available for those in the US that still use 
it. 

HELP-INDEX>Bottom Status Bar Information
                        Bottom Status Bar Information

At the bottom of the window various status messages are available:

 In the first box general status messages are displayed.

 The second box displays the current lat/long position of the mouse over the
 map.

 A third box is used to display how many stations are in the database.

 The fourth box will display the current zoom level and will display "Tr"
 if the station tracking is on.

 The last two boxes will display the tnc and the network status. A ">" will
 display if data is sending out, and a "<" if data is coming in from the 
 interface.


HELP-INDEX>Moving the Map (panning and zooming) and the Options Menu

                    Moving the Map and the Options Menu

Map movement is very simple, ease and quickness of movement is dependent on
your processor speed and the amount of detail you load.

All Movement and Zooming can be done by left clicking on the map (and holding
the button down) This will bring up an options menu. This operation is 
different than previous versions.

All zooming functions will zoom in or out at the point on the map where you
clicked the left mouse button. Zoom levels has a cascade menu. Levels 1-3 
are for very local areas and Levels 4-6 are for large area. The lower number
the level the more local the area.

Panning is also accomplished by the options menu. The maps' position will
change from the center of the window.

The "Station Info" selection on the option menu will look for the closest 
station when you left clicked the mouse. If more than one station is close
to that position a "Station chooser" list will appear, then you can choose
what stations' data you want to look at. If only one station is close then
the stations' data will display.

HELP-INDEX>Map Options and Map Chooser

                       Map Options and Map Chooser

Map Options:

Auto maps (on/off)
 When on, any map found in the map directory (or any directory under it) will
be displayed, if it falls within the current display region. You can add any
number of directory levels under the main map directory for your maps. Auto 
maps will go through them all and find what map (or part) should be displayed. 
All Maps will be merged in to the viewing area. If you have a large quantity of
maps, very detailed maps or a slower computer this can be quite slow. When
this option is off, maps selected with the Map Chooser will be displayed.

Map Grid (on/off)
 When on, this option will display a grid line every 10 degrees.

Map levels (on/off)
 When on, this option will try to filter out data when the zoom level show
large areas. This does not work will all maps but will work with the maps 
generated from Tiger Line maps at the aprs.rutgers.edu site.


Map Chooser
 This will present you with a list of all files in your map directory. Any map
you would like to include in the displayed data, just click on the name. This 
will highlight the map name, You can select any number of maps. Clicking the 
OK button will display the selected maps. Cancel will abandon any changes.

HELP-INDEX>Display Options

                                Display Options

These options will allow you to display data about the station around the 
stations icon on the map.

Altitude (on/off)
 When on, a blue line of data will appear above the call sign. This will
display the last know altitude of the station.

Course (on/off)
 When on, a green line of data will appear below the call sign. This will 
display the last know course (in degrees) the station is traveling.

Speed (on/off)
 When on, a red line will appear below the call sign (or course). This
will display the last know speed the station is traveling.

Dist/course (on/off)
 When on, two lines of information will be displayed on the left side of the
stations' icon. The top line will contain the distance from your station to
this station. The bottom line will contain the course from your station to
this station. 

Station trails (on/off)
 When on, any moving station will trail a colored line with the last 100+ 
 locations. When the station becomes old and icon is ghosted the track line
 will become a dashed rather than solid line.
 

Station Power/Gain (on/off)
 When on, Power/Gain Circles will be displayed.

Track Station
 Will bring up a pop-up box similar to the locate station option. You can enter
 all or part of the call sign. When selecting "Track Now!" The display will
 jump to the location of the station (if one is found). When new data for that 
 station is found the display will track along with that station.
 
 The "Clear Tracking" button will clear all tracking.

 The "Cancel" button will exit with no changes made.

Weather Info (on/off)
 When on, the latest weather data (temp,wind speed/course/gust,Humidity) 
 is displayed.


HELP-INDEX>Messages

                                  Messages

Send message to and Open Group messages
 These are very similar. The "Send message to" will send your messages to one 
station and will only receive data form that station. Group messages are more
general you can receive any message for the group and you will send out your 
messages to that group name. Group messages may not work the best right now
there are various problems that need to be worked out. However, back to the
use of these screens. 
 Each of these screens contain a message box, a call line, a message line, 
and various buttons. You must first enter the call of the group or station 
you want to contact. Once that is done any new message that has come in from 
that station to you will be displayed. If the station is sending you 
information and no message window is up it will automatically pop up a new 
window (up to 10) with that stations call sign filled in for you. You can now
enter a message on the message line. The message can be longer that the 
message line, and will max out about 250+ characters. Once your message is
entered, clicking on the "Send Now!" button will send your message out. The
"Send Now!" button will gray out until your message is completely Acked.
Any message you receive will be sorted by the line # and be placed in the 
message window. If you are in a group mode each line will display the call 
sign from where the message was sent followed by the message itself. Currently
group messages are sorted by call and then line #. When you are done sending
messages clicking on the exit button will close the window. Two other buttons
are also available. The "New Call" button will allow you to look at old data
a station has sent. Type in the call and click on this button, any old
information will be displayed. You can also use this button to change the call
of the station your talking with. Enter the new call and click the button. The
Clear Messages button will clear any message displayed in the message window.


Clear all outgoing messages
 This will clear all un-acked out message you have sent.

Auto Reply Msg
 This will turn on an automatic reply when a incoming message is received.

Set Auto reply message
 This will set the message that is sent.

HELP-INDEX>TNC Options

                             TNC Options

Station Transmit (on/off)

Just listen on RF or if your not a HAM and should not transmit. With
This option (which is default to off) you can control transmitting any 
data via RF. 

Data Logging (on/off)
 If this is on, a log file will be created in the log directory. The file
will be called tnc.log and it will be appended with all the information
heard via RF.
 
Transmit Now!
 This will transmit your stations position/info when you click on this
selection. It will not transmit if the "Use TNC?" option is not selected
(in the Configure - TNC/Port section) or if the above station transmit
option is set to off.

HELP-INDEX>NET Options

 If this is on, a log file will be created in the log directory. The file
will be called net.log and it will be appended with all the information
heard via the Internet.
 
Transmit Now!
 This will transmit your stations position/info when you click on this
selection. It will not transmit if the above station transmit option is 
set to off.

HELP-INDEX>Station info box - FCC and RAC lookup

                   Station info box - FCC and RAC lookup

Station Info will display any data decoded by Xastir.

Currently two three buttons appear here besides the close button.

The Clear Track buttons will clear any line tracking for this station
that is currently stored or on the map display.

Send message will open up the message window and allow you to send a message
to this station. It will fill in the callsign for you.

If the FCC database is installed, a Search FCC Database button will appear
in this box. If the RAC (Radio Amateurs of Canada) database is installed, 
a Search RAC Database button will appear for callsigns beginning with a "V".

You may use this button to add the Stations name and address to the
Station Info box.

To use the FCC lookup download:
 ftp://ftp.fcc.gov/pub/XFS_AlphaTest/amateur/appl.zip
 or the New database at
 ftp://ftp.fcc.gov/pub/Bureaus/Wireless/Databases/uls/complete/l_amat.zip
  (The only file needed form this 40Meg zip is the EN.dat file)

To use the RAC lookup download:
 ftp://ftp.rac.ca/pub/cdncaldb.zip

Xastir will create index files for each database file upon startup.
If a callsign file is dropped in while Xastir is running, it will create
or rebuild the index on the next lookup.

Special prefixes are NOT handled.

HELP-INDEX>Clearing the screen of stations

                     Clearing the screen of stations

Click on file and then "Clear All Stations". This will wipe the all the
data from the station database except yours.

HELP-INDEX>Clearing the screen of line tracks

                    Clearing the screen of line tracks

Click on file and then "Clear All Tracks". This will wipe the all the
line tracking data from the station database and refresh the screen.

HELP-INDEX>Replaying a log

                             Replaying a log

Click on "Open Log File" a file selector window will display. You can
use it to browse your hard drive and select any file containing raw TNC
data like those created by the TNC and Net options.
 Your station will still function the same way, receiving and transmitting.
And there should be a word of warning here, if your data contains a message
session and you have your station set to transmit, It will respond to the 
file as if the data was received over the TNC or Internet. 


HELP-INDEX>Locating a Station

                            Locating a Station

Click on "View" then, "Locate a Station" a window will pop up. You can
now enter a call or part of a call. By default it will search for an 
exact match (full call, not partial) and is not case sensitive. If you
are looking for a partial match, "Match Exact" should not be selected.
Actually you can use this to locate a station or an object. Which is
where we come to the "Match Case" option. I have noticed that some 
objects are in mixed case or lower case. With "Match Case" selected, 
the locator will look for upper and lower case as you entered it. If
"Match Case" is not selected, the locator will assume any case you type
in is uppercase and will search on that. Clicking on the "Locate Now!"
button will center the first station found in the center of your screen
at the current zoom level. Clicking on "Cancel" will close the window.
