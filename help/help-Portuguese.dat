HELP-INDEX>Welcome! and Notes from the Authors

                      Welcome! and Notes from the Authors

XASTIR, or X-windows Amateur Station Tracking and Information Reporting.

Xastir is an APRS(tm)-like program that is Open Source and free to use and 
pass out to others. Currently this program is in development and should 
not be seen as a finished product! Your help will be needed to make this
a better program.  If you have programming skills and/or can write 
documentation, your help may be needed! We have a lot of ideas but very 
little time, so if you think you can add something to the effort let us
know!



APRS(tm) is a Trademark of Bob Bruninga, his home page is at
"http://web.usna.navy.mil/~bruninga/aprs.html". A great deal of information
on APRS(tm) can be found in the APRSdos documentation written by
Bob Bruninga. An additional source of information is the APRS(tm)
specification, available from http://www.tapr.org .

HELP-INDEX>What's new in Xastir 1.1

                    What's new in Xastir 1.1

This new release, Xastir 1.1, adds significant new features and enhancements
to the user interface. Unlike 1.0, the interface changes will take some getting
used to, but the flexibility and versatility of the enhanced interface will
more than make up for the troubles.
Among the improvements to the user interface:
* Keyboard shortcuts for menus and dialogs, menu reorganization, and mouse
  behavior changes.
* The ability to move objects or measure distance with the mouse, using the
  appropriate checkboxes in the toolbar.
* A scale has been added to allow one to judge distance on a map.
* Map labels for windows-style APRS(tm) maps are rotated to match the marked
  map features.
* The user interface for dealing with objects has been entirely redesigned.
* Station info boxes can be set to automatically update.
* Tear-off menus.  Allow you to keep a menu on the screen and play with
  different options. Tear off a menu by clicking on the dashed-line portion.

Map support has been greatly enhanced, with PocketAPRS, ESRI Shapefiles, GNIS
labels and many graphics formats with ImageMagick. Additionally, support for
downloading graphical maps from webservers has been added, allowing Xastir to
use online radar, Tiger, and Terraserver maps. 

Xastir 1.1 supports much more of the APRS(tm) protocol than its predecessor:
* It can add, modify, move and view area objects, signpost objects, and items.
  These features are invaluable for event coordination and search and rescue
  use. Objects and items are also periodically retransmitted.
* Support for displaying position ambiguity squares, precalculated radio
  ranges, Maidenhead grid squares, and weather objects. These features aren't
  extremely common, but do come up occasionally.
* Support for the APRS(tm) radio direction finding features. These features
  are useful for anything from tracking jammers to locating lost hikers. Xastir
  supports both Omni and Beam reports.
  
Other notable improvements:
* Xastir can now search for a specified location or landmark using GNIS data.
* Track logs can now be exported to file.
* Maps can be printed if certain tools and libraries are present.
* Support for retrieving historical track data from findu.com.
* Xastir now compiles and runs on Mac OS X, Solaris and FreeBSD with only
  minimal changes; see README.1ST for details. 
* Several major bugs found in 1.0 have been corrected, including the problems
  loading DOS maps and the problems with the weather reporting. Other minor
  bugs and memory leaks have been fixed. And several more errors have been
  corrected in the parsing routines, so Xastir should remain stable no matter
  what is thrown at it! 

HELP-INDEX>Starting Xastir for the first time

                    Starting Xastir for the first time

When first running Xastir, you should start it from a terminal window so
that any warning or error messages can be seen. On most systems a path is
set up to run programs in /usr/local/bin and all you need to do is type
"xastir &" at the prompt. On systems that do not have this path installed
type "/usr/local/bin/xastir &" to start the program.  The '&' character
will cause Xastir to start in the background, leaving the terminal window
available for other uses.

You may also set the language choice at this time. To set the language or
change the current language choice, call Xastir with the option '-l':

    xastir -lEnglish

Other language options are:
    xastir -lDutch
    xastir -lFrench
    xastir -lGerman
    xastir -lItalian
    xastir -lSpanish

The chosen language will be stored in your config file, so it is
preserved for the next time you call Xastir without this option.
For new installs Xastir will default to English until you change the
language with this command line option.

The menus on the top may be accessed with the mouse, or with keyboard
shortcuts. The keyboard shortcuts don't work correctly with numlock on.

You will need to configure Xastir, and some interfaces to use.
Interface configuration is detailed under the "Configuring Interfaces" help
topic and its subtopics.

HELP-INDEX>Configure the Station Information

                         Configure the Station Information

Click on File, then Configure, then Station.

Fill in your Amateur Station call sign.

Fill in your station position if you are not using Xastir with a GPS 
unit. You can locate your general position on the map with Xastir and
use the position given by the cursor placement over the map. This
position will be viewable in the box at the bottom of the Xastir screen
2nd from the left, whenever the mouse is over the drawing area. If you
have a GPS you can skip this and set up the GPS later.

To select a symbol to be used for your station you need to specify
a group and a symbol character. You can manually fill in these fields,
or press select to graphically choose a symbol. There are two groups
of symbols available. A text description of each symbol can be found
in the "symbol table" help topic.

For some symbols of the secondary group you can specify an overlay.
With that a symbol will be displayed together with an additional
overlay character, e.g. a car symbol with the number 1 atop.

For using overlays you need to select a symbol from the secondary symbol
table and enter the overlay character to be shown in the group/overlay
field. Only numbers and uppercase characters are allowed as overlay
characters. According to the APRS(tm) specification not every symbol can
be overlayed, Xastir doesn't enforce this, but some other programs may.
Note that not all of the symbols have been implemented in the graphics
chooser yet, and some of them are not per the APRS(tm) spec yet.

Next, enter the data for the power/height/gain of your station. This
is useful information but is not required; simply select "Disable PHG"
to disable it. These choices present a granular representation of your
stations range. Select the combination of values closest to the
description of your station.

Another option would be to specify the RNG in the comment field in miles
instead of using PHG. See the APRS(tm) spec for details.
    
Please use height above average terrain (HAAT) for the height value. 
Do NOT use average height above sea level or height above ground.

For Gain use the gain of your antenna in dBi. 
(FIXME: dBd? spec is unclear, I think it's implying dBi because it says "in
absence of any data, stations are assumed to be running 10w to a 3dB omni at
20ft. A typical omni is only 3dBi.....) 

Note: The gain setting is really intended for vertical antennas; the gain
setting for a beam should be quite a bit below the forward gain of the beam.
This is because with directivity set, the PHG circle is only offset by 1/3rd
of its size toward the specified direction. Setting gain higher will enlarge
the whole circle unrealistically, rather than increasing the directivity.
There was talk several years ago about ammending the specifications to better
deal with beam antennas, but nothing was changed.

Enter a comment, not required but it will add insight on your station.
A common thing to enter here is your preferred e-mail address.  It will
be transmitted along with your posits.

Position ambiguity will allow you control how accurate you transmit your
position. A setting of none will allow your station to transmit the exact
position you have entered or received from a GPS. The other choices will
place you somewhere in the range of the choice you selected.  Note that
this may throw some non-spec compliant stations for a loop.  Findu.com
doesn't understand position ambiguity.

Clicking OK will save your changes, Clicking on Cancel will keep the
previous settings.

HELP-INDEX>Configure Default Operation

                        Configure Default Operation

Click on File, then Configure, then Defaults.

This page sets up some standard defaults for the program operation. Old
stations will be displayed with a ghosted icon, and the corresponding trail
will be fragmented.

The first set of toggle buttons specify the ghosting interval.  The second
set of buttons specify when a station will be removed from the screen.
Stations are also removed from the internal database at double this time,
so if you set it for 6 hours, stations will be deleted from the database
at 12 hours.

The third set of buttons specify how often your station's posit will be
transmitted.  For fixed stations a good recommendation is every 30 minutes,
and definitely no less than 10 minutes.  Mobile stations may wish a faster
rate.  This interval is also used for sending out objects and items.  Try
to keep this interval somewhat reasonable, as transmitting to a long path
every 30 seconds will really take up a lot of the air time.

GPS Time will set the interval of time to look at the GPS for new data. This
is available for stations using an HSP or shared cable with their TNC.

Transmit Station Option sets the type of packet your station will transmit 
its data as.

IGate Options will set your station up as an Internet-RF gateway. This option
should be used with caution; As a ham you are responsible for the data that
comes in via the Internet and is transmitted via RF. You also will need to
choose an igate option on each interface in order for the igate to function.
If you want to have your igate forward NWS weather alerts to RF, you must
create a ~/.xastir/data/nws-stations.txt file listing each call or NWS station
(like "PHISVR") that you would like to transmit via RF.
                     
"Compress position data while transmitting?", if selected, will transmit in
the newer compressed format. This format will reduce the amount of data on
the air, thereby increasing the capacity of the APRS(tm) network. The maximum
precision of the transmitted position is also higher. Some older programs,
including even recent versions of WinAPRS, do not decode this format yet.
Findu.com might also have trouble with it.

"Transmit Raw WX data", if selected, will also send a packet containing raw
Weather Station Data. This is useful on ASCII types of WX stations, 
like Peet Bros. WX stations.

You can also select Altnet and choose an altnet call from this dialog. Altnet 
allows you to have a private APRS(tm) network among the stations that also
have altnet configured, and have the same altnet call entered.

HELP-INDEX>Configure Audio Alarms

                           Configure Audio Alarms

Click on File, then Configure, then Audio Alarms.

To use this option you must have a sound card and a program that will play
wav files. The Audio Play Command should contain the program you want to
execute to play the audio file (and any command line options). That of
course doesn't work if the only soundcard in the system is used for a
soundmodem...

The fields will contain the name of the file to play. Fields under the option
will set parameters for the option.

The current choices are:
Play message on hearing a new station.
Play message on receiving a new message.
Play message on receiving data from a station within the min/max distance of
     your proximity settings. 
Play message on receiving data from a station (via TNC) within the min/max
     distance of your band opening settings.
Play message on receiving and displaying a new weather alert.

HELP-INDEX>Configure Speech

                       Configure Speech Synthesis

To use this option you must have a sound card and the 'festival' speech
synthesis software installed.  Install Festival and start it in 'server' 
mode prior to starting up XASTIR.  The normal command for this is 
"festival --server &".

Once you have festival installed, Xastir will have the ability to speak using
the following choices:

New Station       - Announce the call of a new station.
New Message Alert - Announce the arrival of a new message.
New Message Body  - Speak the contents of a message.
Proximity Alert   - Announce when receiving data from a station within the
    min.max distance of your proximity settings.  This option uses the 
    proximity settings found in the Audio Alarms menu.
Tracked station Proximity Alert - Announce when receiving data from a
    station within the min.max distance of the tracked station. This option
    uses the proximity settings found in the Audio Alarms menu.
Band Opening      - Announce when receiving data from a station (via TNC) 
    within the min/max distance of your band opening settings.  This option 
    uses the distance settings found in the Audio Alarms menu.
New Weather Alert - Not implemented yet.

Info on Festival may be obtained from: http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/festival/

HELP-INDEX>Configure Units of Measure

                        Configure Units of Measure

The default selection is for the Metric System: mm, cm, km/h, etc. To select
English units, inches, feet, MPH, etc. Click on File, then Configure, then
toggle the "Enable English Units" checkbox.

HELP-INDEX>Save Config Now!

                        Save Config Now!

This button will save all of the current configuration to the config file.
Note that when Xastir is closed, it also saves configuration to the config
file.

HELP-INDEX>Bottom Status Bar

                         Bottom Status Bar

At the bottom of the window various status messages are available:

In the first box on the left general status messages are displayed for a
short time.

The second box displays the current lat/long position of the mouse over the
map. 

A third box is used to display how many stations are in the database.

The fourth box will display the current zoom level and will display "Tr" if
the station tracking is on. 

The last area will display the device status for each interface. Each will
display in order first to last or 0 to 9. The interface status is separated
into three areas, top device type, center data flow, and bottom interface
operational status.

The device type will show what interfaces are configured. The color will
show what type of device the interface is configured for. Blues are for
the various TNC devices; Greens will show the GPS devices; Yellow for
Internet Servers; Orange for WX interfaces.

The center will show data flow in (arrow pointing left) or data flow out
(arrow pointing right) for that interface.

A green box at the bottom will show if that interface is active. A red
box will show if the interface is active but in an error condition.
Otherwise nothing will show if the interface is not active.

HELP-INDEX>Moving the Map and the Options Menu

                    Moving the Map and the Options Menu

Map movement is very simple, ease and quickness of movement is dependent on
your processor speed and the amount of detail you load.

Zooming:
Zooming can be accomplished by right clicking on the map (and holding the 
button down). This will bring up an options menu, with choices to zoom in or
out a single level, or to change to one of the preset zoom levels.

All zooming functions from the options menu will zoom in or out at the point
on the map where you clicked the right mouse button. Zoom levels have a cascade
menu. Levels 1-64 are for very local areas and levels 256 and above are for
large areas. The lower number the level, the more local the area.

A quicker zoom in function is to push and hold the left mouse button, drag it
across the area of interest and let go.  The map will zoom to approximately
the size of the square you just described with the mouse drag operation.
The program uses the vertical component to decide on the zoom level, and the
vertical and horizontal components to compute the new map center.  The "move"
and "measure" toolbar checkboxes must be disabled for this feature to work.

The map can also be zoomed with the keyboard PageUp/PageDown keys.  The
zooming in this case keeps the same map center. 

Panning/Centering:
The map can be centered at a specific location by choosing center in the
right-click options menu. Clicking the middle button zooms out with a factor
of 2, centering where you clicked.

Panning is also accomplished by using the options menu, or by using the arrow
buttons on the top of the screen. The map position will shift a portion of a
screen. Enough data from the previous screen should be available to reorient
yourself.

The map can also be panned with the keyboard arrow keys.

More About Options Menu:
The "Station Info" selection on the options menu will look for the station
closest to where you right clicked the mouse. If more than one station is
close to that position a "Station chooser" list will appear, then you can
choose what station's data you want to look at. If only one station is close
to the mouse pointer then that station's data will display immediately. For
mobile stations with a lot of track data this could need some time on slow
computers. Note that expired stations still have their data stored in the
Xastir database, and if one knows a station's former location, one can still
view its info in this manner. It is also possible to display old stations by
turning on the "Display Expired Data" option in the stations menu.
FIXME: Not entirely true.  This just displays some of the data that
dissapears for ghosted stations, like speed/altitude, etc.

With "Last Map View" you can restore the previous map view by restoring the
previous values of the map zoom and centering values.

For Object and Item information, please see the help topic "Objects and Items"

HELP-INDEX>Objects and Items

A station could place several different objects on the map, with their
position transmitted to other stations. The object names are less restrictive
than the normal station names.

Objects and items are nearly the same things, but their use could differ a bit.
Objects are generally used for moving or variable things such as thunderstorms,
while items are generally used for more inanimate things, such as water
stations. Because items may not be decoded by some flavors of APRS(tm)
programs, objects are often used for inanimated things, too.

Besides normal objects with a symbol at its position there are some special
objects available. Area objects are useful for a variety of operations in
which you want to draw or highlight an area of interest on the map. They can
also be used to draw trails/roads/boundaries, watchboxes for severe weather,
runways, perimeters of a search area or of a public service event, areas of
damage, areas to stay out of, buildings that aren't on the map, checker/chess
boards for gaming on APRS(tm). :-)  Note that area objects are not
implemented on all versions of APRS(tm) programs, and some of the details of
how they are displayed may also be different on other programs.
For the other two, signpost and DF objects, see below.

Objects are retransmitted at the rate of station position reports, configured
in File|Configure|Defaults, and will cease retransmitting after double the
station display time, also configured there. "killed" objects are also
retransmitted in this manner, until they expire from the queue.


The Object/Item creation option in the right click menu will bring up a dialog
with the position of your object filled in based on where you clicked the
mouse. You may fill in the details, and add an object/item from this menu.

The Object/Item modification option brings you the object modification dialog.
It is similar to the object creation dialog, except the object's current
information is already filled out, and the object's name and a few of the
other options can't be changed. You could also delete the object with this
option.

Objects and items can be moved with the mouse if the "Move" checkbox on the
toolbar is enabled.  


Description of the entries in the object dialogue:

= Signpost =
This makes the object a signpost object. These signs can be 3 characters,
visible on a signpost at the location when zoomed in close. (FIXME: We don't
do the display of signposts this way yet).

= Area Object =
This makes the object an area object, and enables the area object controls
described below.

= DF Object =
This is a direction-finding report. Enabling it allows you to choose Omni or
Beam report, and allows you to put in the specifics for each.  See:
    http://web.usna.navy.mil/~bruninga/dfing.html
and the APRSdos documentation for details on these useful techniques.
(FIXME: Separate section on DFing techniques?)

= Name =
This is the name of the object or item. It may be up to 9 characters long,
with spaces allowed inside the name. When modifying an object, this may not
be changed. To rename an object you must delete the original and then create
a new object. Note that if you select Signpost/Area Object/DF Object that
this field and perhaps others are cleared. Enter the name AFTER you've
selected the type of object it will become.

= Station Symbol =
You may select a symbol for the object. Press select to choose graphically,
or see the symbol table help section for descriptions of each symbol. Note
that not all of the symbols have been implemented in the graphics chooser yet,
and some are not per the APRS(tm) spec. Note also that area objects, signpost
objects, and DF objects have special fixed symbols and therefore can't be
selected here.

= Location =
The location of the object is specified here. If you selected "Create 
Object/Item" from the right-click menu, the location you clicked will be filled
in. If you moved an object with the mouse, the new location will be in these
fields.  You can also type in a location, for instance you may be placing an
object from an over-the-air voice report.

= Generic Options =
You may specify the speed, direction, and altitude of objects here. Some object
types cannot have a speed or direction, in which case the fields are grey'ed
out.

= Signpost Text =
If the object is a signpost object, you may specify the 1 to 3 character
message that appears on the sign here.  Note that Xastir doesn't display
signpost objects properly yet.

= Area Object =
Area Objects are used to highlight specific parts of maps, or to draw extra
detail onto maps. This will be done with the following entries:
  = Bright Color =
    Use the brighter version of the colors allowed.
  = Color-Fill =
    The area should be filled, not just outlined. This may be useful to
    exclude an area from a search or other event.
  = Object Type =
    Choose from the geometric shapes allowed.
  = Object Color =
    Choose the color in which the object will display. This is also affected
    by the "Bright Color" option above.
  = Object Offset Up =
    In hundredths of a degree latitude.  An unfortunate detail of the spec,
    and hard to calculate easily.  Suffice it to say that you can change
    the size of the object once you place it.
  = Object Offset Left except / =
    In hundredths of a degree longitude.  See above.
  = Object corridor =
    This is the width of a line area object. Useful for runways, weather
    watchboxes, describing an area of interest or an area of exclusion, etc.
(FIXME: Write this part! (area objects) The spec is unclear to me, the code
is unclear to me, but eventually I'll figure it all out!)

Always delete your objects and items when you are done with them!
Don't just allow them to expire from your cache, as they may hang
around on other people's screens for an extended period.

HELP-INDEX>View Menu

                     View Menu Options

The View menu presents various ways to look at data in Xastir.

Bulletins
This is the APRS(tm) bulletin board, where important announcements are posted.
If you are connected with the internet interface, it is a good idea to set the
range field to a few hundred miles, to ignore posts from other portions of the
world. "0" in the range field means the entire world. Click the "Change range"
button to make changes to this field effective. Xastir currently does not
support sending bulletins.

Incoming packet data
This displays the incoming data on your TNC or internet interface. The radio
buttons below select if you want to see only TNC data, only internet data, or
both.

Mobile Stations
This is a list of stations that are moving. Stations qualify for this list if
they have moved (more than one position received for them), the symbol of the
station is not considered. Information shown includes course, speed, altitude,
position, number of packets received, number of visible GPS satellites, course
from your station, and distance from your station. 

All Stations
This option displays a table of all stations sorted alphabetically. It includes
the number of packets heard, the time the station was last heard, the path that
the most recent packet took, the PHG, and the comment of the station.

Local stations
This option displays only stations that are heard via your TNC. It includes
the number of packets heard, the time the station was last heard, the path that
the most recent packet took, the PHG, and the comment of the station.

Last Stations
This option displays a table of all stations sorted from most recently heard
to least recently heard. It includes the number of packets heard, the time
the station was last heard, the path that the most recent packet took, the PHG,
and the comment of the station.

WX stations
This option displays a table of all the APRS(tm) weather stations and their data.
Data includes wind course, wind speed, wind gust speed, temperature, humidity,
barometric pressure, rain in the past hour, rain since midnight, and rain in
the last 24 hours.

Own weather data
Displays your weather data if you have a weather station and have configured
Xastir to access it.

Weather Alerts
Displays weather alerts received, including the alert flags, alert source/type,
alert destination, expiration, message, and effected location. This data
is used for the county highlighting, and is not particulary human-readable.
You can generally figure out the state and county for most of the alerts though.

Message Traffic
Shows all message traffic while the window is open. It includes the source,
destination, interface, and message. The range option can limit this display
to nearby stations, much like the range control on bulletins. A range of 0
causes all messages to be displayed.

Uptime
Shows the amount of time elapsed since Xastir was started.

HELP-INDEX>Map Options and Map Chooser

                       Map Options and Map Chooser

Map Options:

Map Chooser
This will present you with a list of map files in your map directory. Click
on map names to highlight them, this will cause them to be displayed when
you click the OK button.  You may select any number of maps. Clicking the
OK button will display the selected maps. Cancel will abandon any changes.
There are also shortcut buttons to select all of a certain type of map,
or deselect all of the maps at once.

Map Display Bookmarks
See the help topic "Creating and using Jump Locations"

Locate Map Feature
This option brings up a search dialog where you can search through the labels
in a GNIS file to find a specific location.  It will center the map on the
new location if it is found. The "GNIS File:" entry is saved between calls
and between invocations of Xastir.

Disable All Maps
This option disables the loading of any maps. It is most useful when doing
rapid zooming or panning, because it saves the need to load the maps on each
redraw.  Note that this option is not saved between sessions.

Enable Auto Maps
When enabled, any map found in the map directory (or any directory under it)
will be displayed if it falls within the current display region. You can add
any number of directory levels under the main map directory for your maps. Auto
maps will go through them all and find what map (or part) should be displayed.
All Maps will be merged into the viewing area. If you have a large quantity
of maps, very detailed maps or a slower computer this can be quite slow. When
this option is off, maps selected with the Map Chooser will be displayed.

Enable Map Grid
When enabled, this option will display a grid line every 10 degrees.  As you
zoom in it switches to a 1 degree spacing.

Enable Map Levels
When enabled, this option will try to filter out data when the zoom level shows
large areas. This does not work will all maps but will work with the maps
generated from Tiger Line maps at the aprs.rutgers.edu site. This does not
decrease the loading times of the maps, rather it simply reduces screen
clutter.

Enable Map Labels
This option toggles the display of map labels embedded in dosAPRS, winAPRS,
GNIS, and ESRI shapefile format maps.

Enable Area Color Fills
This option controls the filling of vector maps. In certain cases, you
may want to eliminate the fill to see maps below the top maps. Maps are
loaded in alphabetical order by type, so renaming maps is a second but
less elegant way to achieve the look you want.

Enable Weather Alert Counties
This toggles the display of county warning area maps for severe weather.
These maps can be obtained at the locations listed in the "Map files" help
topic. They are displayed on screen when special weather alert messages
are received, and expire after a time or can be remotely cancelled. The
weather alert text can be seen under View|WX Alerts.

Background color
This option controls the color of the background behind the maps you have
displayed. The background color is often entirely hidden by filled maps
(see above).

Map Intensity
This controls the brightness of any graphics used as maps. This option only
appears if you have compiled with GeoTIFF support and/or ImageMagick.
FIXME: XPM also?

Station Text Style
Controls which font and style to use for station text and others.

Mouse pointer menu
This option brings up the options menu normally available by right clicking.

One note on maps:  Many of the currently available vector maps for the
U.S. were created in NAD 1927 datum, while Xastir and other APRS(tm) programs
use WGS 1984 datum.  If zoomed in to a small area on the map the datum
shift may be very noticeable.  The USGS topo maps have their datum
corrected by Xastir as they are displayed, so positions will generally
be more accurate with those topo maps.

Map Types
Xastir will work with various types of map files. All DosAPRS, Windows/Mac
APRS(TM) map files are supported. Additionally, Xastir natively supports
PocketAPRS format maps, GNIS (Geographic Names Information System) labels
and XPixmap format graphics. Xastir also can be compiled to use external
libraries to support GeoTIFF topographic maps, and ESRI shapefile maps.
The graphics handling capability of Xastir can be greatly extended by
compiling with ImageMagick support, enabling support for many graphic
formats as maps (see "http://www.imagemagick.org/www/formats.html").
Xastir supports weather alert maps in the classic dos/winaprs format,
but support for the new ESRI shapefile format for weather alerts should
be completed soon.

Details of locations to obtain many of the above types of maps are found in
the file README.1ST

Map Locations
Any map file should be stored in the /usr/local/xastir/maps directory on your
computer. You can create any number of directories under this directory to
help organize and separate your data. The maps will be listed in
alphabetical order with their relative path in the Map Choser dialogue.
Symbolic links could help to reorganize the order.

Hints on installing and organizing maps are found in README.1ST.
 
Maps in a pixel graphics format actually need a combination of two files,
a data file with a graphic pixmap (.xpm) (or other format if you compiled
with ImageMagick), and a calibration file (.geo). The .xpm file is the
standard graphic format, available without additional libraries. If you
want to save storage space you can use gzip to compress those files 
("gzip map.xpm" will result in "map.xpm.gz"). Xastir detects this
automatically during map loading. You can use XView/Gimp/ImageMagick and
other programs to convert gif, jpg, and tif images into this format if
you didn't compile with ImageMagick. If you get problems with maps in
xpm format, please try to load and save the graphics with Gimp first, to
convert all unknown colournames into the binary representation.

The geo file is a text data file that will tie the image to a location
in the world. Here is an example of my world1.geo file:

FILENAME   world1.xpm
#          x          y        lon         lat
TIEPOINT   0          0        -180        90
TIEPOINT   640        320      180         -90

This is a simple file with 4 basic components:
o The first line specifies the file this .geo data is used with, if using
  compressed .xpm files the ".gz" extension is optional here. If no path
  is specified with the graphics file name, Xastir looks for the file in
  the same directory where the .geo file is. 
  If you compiled Xastir with ImageMagick support, besides .xpm, the file
  can be any graphics format that ImageMagick itself supports and for
  which supporting libraries that ImageMagick requires are also present.
  The FILENAME portion can also be replaced by a URL statement, and Xastir
  will download the graphic using wget. This means that nearly any picture
  available via HTTP or FTP over the internet can be used as a map.
o The second line shows a comment; any line with the first character as a 
  '#' will be ignored.
o The last two lines are for connecting an x,y pixel position in the image
  to a lat and long position on the earth. Two tie points are needed and
  should be as close as possible to the upper left corner and the lower
  right corner of the image (for accuracy). To use pixmap files with
  Xastir, use the map chooser and select the .geo file to include the
  image in the current map view.

For speed reasons, another optional line may be included in the .geo file:

FILENAME        Agnes_Mountain.xpm.gz
#
#               X       Y       Lon             Lat
#               ----    ----    -------------   -----------
TIEPOINT        0       0       -121.00120491   48.37481943
TIEPOINT        1337    1999    -120.87619806   48.24982052
#
IMAGESIZE       1338    2000

The IMAGESIZE is the size of the graphic file in pixels. Xastir will use that
information and the tiepoints to skip the map if it doesn't fit in the current
view. If this information is omitted, Xastir will always load the graphic.

There are several "special" .geo files that Xastir can use:
o A file with just the word "TIGERMAP" will cause Xastir to retrieve an
  online Tiger map of the area on screen.
o A file with just the word "TERRASERVER" will cause Xastir to retrieve a
  Terraserver satellite photo of the area on screen. Those services are not
  available for every place in the world. Note that using the Terraserver
  maps at any zoom above 256 will probably take a long time to load, won't
  show much detail, and probably won't display correctly. This is a limit
  of the Terraserver, not Xastir.
o A file with the word "FINDU" and the second line "CALL <callsign>" will
  retrieve historical data for the specified callsign, although using the
  Stations menu is easier now. 

  
geoTIFF maps are a combination of two files as well: a .tif and a .fgd file.
The .tif file is the actual map data.  The .fgd file need only contain four
lines like this (but may contain many other lines):

1.5.1.1   WEST BOUNDING COORDINATE:  -122.000000
1.5.1.2   EAST BOUNDING COORDINATE:  -120.000000
1.5.1.3   NORTH BOUNDING COORDINATE:  48.000000
1.5.1.4   SOUTH BOUNDING COORDINATE:  47.000000

Xastir uses those four lines in it's calculations to determine the corner
points of a map, to see whether the map fits in the current viewport (so it
can decide whether to skip it).  If your map data are USGS topo maps, the .fgd
file should be readily available to you. An added feature in Xastir is the
ability to do datum translations from NAD 1927 to WGS 84 datum, which makes the
USGS topo maps much more positionally accurate on the Xastir screen. If you
don't have the .fgd file, the map will load fine, but the white borders won't
be cropped and the size and rotation may be off a tad bit.

Xastir can now use USGS geoTIFF topo maps directly from the CD drive.
Either manually mount the disk or use automounter to do it for you, and
make sure you have a symlink created in your maps directory that points
to where you mounted your CDROM drive.  That's it!

Shapefile maps are also a combination of several files, a .shp file, a .dbf
file, and a .shx file. You only need to select the .shp file to load the map,
but the other(s) must be present for the map to load correctly.

GNIS (Geographic Names Information System) data is a collection of names of
locations, or geographic features. These labels behave like map labels in
Dos/WinAPRS maps.  As you zoom in, more labels will appear, assuming you've
selected the GNIS file as a map and have enabled Map Labels in the Maps menu.

WX County Maps
All WX County maps should be stored in the /usr/local/xastir/Counties
directory. There are different formats for the maps, but either way this
directory will have subdirectories for each state/marine area (2 letter
abbreviations). The older format uses <ST><COUNTYNAME>.map, while the new
format uses <ST>Z<NWSZONECODE>.map. Installation is explained in more detail in
the README.1ST section on obtaining maps.

As NWS messages are received, different areas will get tinted to designate
areas of concern.  They are color-coded to specify different types of
alerts. The original colors were: Cyan for advisory, yellow for watch, red
for warning, orange for cancelled alert, royal blue for tests, and green
for undetermined alert levels. With the latest versions of Xastir the
colors may be different due to a major change:  The areas are tinted now
instead of color-filled, and the tinting depends on the colors underneath.
This change was made so that the underlying maps may still be seen
underneath the weather alert areas. The display of weather alerts may be
turned on/off via the Map menu as well.

HELP-INDEX>Stations Menu

                             Stations Menu

These options will allow you to control the data displayed around the stations
on the map. It will also let you track and find stations, and clear stations
and trails in the database and from the map.

Find Station
See the help topic "Locating a Station".

Track Station
See the help topic "Tracking a Station"

Fetch Findu Trail
Downloads historic trail data from findu.com.  Currently set to two weeks
worth of posits.

Enable Symbols
Determines if symbols should be drawn on the map. Most of the options below
depend on this being enabled.

  For old stations the symbol is drawn ghosted and in its standard orientation.
  Corresponding trails are dashed rather than solid and all data except the
  callsign disappear from the screen.  Exception:  If "Display Expired Data"
  is enabled, then the data will not disappear when ghosting a symbol.

Rotate Symbols
Some symbols will change their orientation to show the direction in which they
are traveling.

Enable Callsign
Determines if the callsign is displayed on the right side of the symbol.

Enable Speed
When on, red text will appear below the call sign (or course). This will
display the last known speed the station is traveling. 

Display Short Speed
This option removes display of the measurement units for speed.

Enable Altitude
When enabled, blue text will appear above the call sign. This will display the
last known altitude of the station.

Enable Course
When enabled, green text will appear below the call sign. This will display the
last known course (in degrees) the station is traveling.

Enable Dist/Course
When enabled, two lines of text will be displayed on the left side of the
stations' icon. The top line will contain the distance from your station to
this station. The bottom line will contain the course from your station to
this station.

Enable Weather Info
When enabled, the latest weather data (temp,wind speed/course/gust,Humidity) is
displayed.

Display Temperature Only
Displays only the temperature data for the station.

Enable Power/Gain
When on, Power/Gain Circles will be displayed. Overlapping circles indicate
that the stations are theoretically within simplex range of one another.
This is only roughly accurate, especially in areas of variable terrain. 

Enable Default Power/Gain
Enables a default power/gain setting as specified in the APRS(tm) specification.

Enable Mobile Power/Gain
Enables power/gain circles for mobile stations.

Enable Position Ambiguity
When enabled, the area in which station using position ambiguity may be located
within is shaded, with the relevant station in the center.

Display Expired data
Causes Xastir to continue to display the station data that normally goes
away when the symbol is ghosted.  The expiration time can be adjusted in the
File|Configure|Defaults menu.

Display DF Circles
When enabled, any DF circles will be displayed on the screen.

Enable Station trails
When enabled, any moving station will trail a colored line with the last 100+
locations.

Clear All Stations
This will wipe all the data from the station database except yours.
This option is useful if you're low on memory.

Clear All Trails
This will wipe all the line tracking data from the station database and
refreshes the screen.  This option is useful if you're low on memory
or just want an uncluttered screen.  You may also clear individual
station's trails from the Station Info dialog.

HELP-INDEX>Messages and the Messages menu

                  Messages and the Messages menu

Send Message to and Open group messages

These are very similar. "Send message to" will send your messages to one
station and will only receive data from that station. Group messages are more
general: you can receive any message for the group and you will send out your
messages to that group name. Group messages code is not fully implemented yet
and various problems still need to be worked out.  The "groups" file is looked
for in ~/.xastir/config.  This is where the groups you are a member of are
stored.  As was said before the "groups" functionality may not be complete yet.

At some point in the near future sending of bulletins should be added to this
menu as well.  It's not coded yet.

Each of these two screens contains a message box, a call line, a message line,
and various buttons. You must first enter the call of the group or station you
want to contact. Once that is done any new message that has come in from that
station to you will be displayed. If the station is sending you information
and no message window is up it will automatically pop up a new window (up to
10) with that station's call sign filled in for you. You can now enter a
message on the message line. The message can be longer that the message line,
and will max out at about 250+ characters. Once your message is entered,
clicking on the "Send Now!" button will send your message. The "Send Now!"
button will gray out until your message is completely Acked. Any message you
receive will be sorted by the line # and be placed in the message window. If
you are in a group mode each line will display the call sign from where the
message was sent followed by the message itself. Currently group messages are
sorted by call and then line #. When you are done sending messages clicking on
the exit button will close the window. Two other buttons are also available.
The "New Call" button will allow you to look at old data a station has sent.
Type in the call and click on this button, any old information will be 
displayed. You can also use this button to change the call of the station
you're talking with. Enter the new call and click the button. The "Clear
Messages" button will clear any message displayed in the message window.

Clear all outgoing messages
This will clear all un-acked messages you have sent.

General Stations Query
This sends an ?APRS? packet, which should cause all local stations to report
their position and/or status. Most software ignores this query, because
responding to it would cause massive floods of data.

Igate Stations Query
This sends an ?IGATE? packet, which should cause all local Igates to respond
with their capabilities.

WX Stations Query
This sends an ?WX? packet, which should cause all local weather stations to
report their position and weather.

Modify Auto reply message
This will set the message that is sent as an Auto Reply.

Enable Auto Reply Msg
This will turn on an automatic reply when an incoming message is received.

HELP-INDEX>Interfaces Menu

                         Interfaces menu

This menu contains interface related options.

Start/Stop
This option displays a window where you can turn on and off your configured
interfaces.

Properties
This choice brings up a list of installed interfaces, and allows you to adjust
their settings. See the "Configure Interfaces" help topic.

Disable Transmit options
These options disable the transmission of everything, one's position, or one's
objects. These are global options and affect all interfaces. Most interfaces
have an option to disable transmission on that specific interface in their
configuration menus also.

Transmit now
Causes all interfaces that have transmit enabled (see configure|interfaces) to
transmit a position packet.  It will be gray'ed out if Disable Transmit: ALL
is selected.

HELP-INDEX>Station info box - FCC and RAC lookup

                  Station info box - FCC and RAC lookup

Station Info will display any data decoded by Xastir.

The information available may include: Number of packets heard, the time
last heard, the device the packet came from, station comments, 
power/height/gain of the station, course/distance from your station,
weather information, and previous positions.

For moving stations a tracklog follows with the most recent entries on top.
A '+' in front indicates that a new track starts at that point (if there was
a large gap in time or position). A star at the end of a line indicates that
this station could be heard direct (without a digi) at that specific position.

For your own station, there is an "Echoed from" field, listing the
last six digipeaters that heard you directly. This is useful for setting
non-generic paths.

Currently two rows of four buttons appear in the Station Info window.  Some
of the labels on the buttons change based on the type of station that you're
dealing with.

For objects/items:

Store     Modify    Blank      Close
Track     Object/
          Item

Station   Trace     Un-Acked   Direct
Version   Query     Messages   Stations
Query               Query      Query

For other stations:

Store     Send      Search     Close
Track     Message   FCC (RAC)
                    Database

Station   Trace     Un-Acked   Direct
Version   Query     Messages   Stations
Query               Query      Query

"Station Version Query" changes to "Clear Track" for mobile stations.
The Clear Track button will clear any line tracking for this station that is
currently stored or on the map display.

Store Track will save that station's track to a file on disk. The used
format is similar to that used by GPS receivers but its specification
might be changed (enhanced) in future versions. There is currently no
way to read that track data back in, but it is planned for the future.
The goal is to also read and display GPS tracklogs in a similar manner.
These tracklog files will be placed in the directory ~/.xastir/tracklogs
with a name equal to the stations call with ".trk" as extension.

Modify Object/Item will bring up the Object Modify window.

Send message will open up the message window and allow you to send a message
to this station. It will fill in the call sign for you.

If the FCC (U.S. Federal Communications Commission) or RAC (Radio Amateurs of
Canada) database is installed and the callsign appears to be a Canadian or
U.S. callsign, the Search FCC/RAC Database button will become active,
otherwise this button will be inactive.  The FCC and RAC files should be
placed in the /usr/local/xastir/fcc directory, and case is important!
Pressing this button adds the station's name and address into the Station
Info box.  Instructions for installing these databases are in the README.1ST
file.

Xastir will create index files for each database file upon startup. If a newer
callsign file is placed there while Xastir is running, it will create or
rebuild the index on the next lookup.  Special prefixes are NOT handled.

HELP-INDEX>Creating a log
                              Creating a log

Xastir can log data from the internet or TNC for later playback, or for
debugging purposes.

All these choices are accessible via the File menu:

Enable TNC Logging
Logs all TNC data received and transmitted. These logs can be played back using
the "Open Log File" feature.

Enable Net logging
Logs all internet data received and transmitted. These logs can be played back
using the "Open Log File" feature.  If you have no interfaces started but still
want to log your posits and objects locally, this is the option to enable for
that as well.

Enable IGate logging
Logs all data forwarded in both directions, and rejected forwards with reasons
for rejection. Includes NWS messages forwarded to RF
(as per ~/.xastir/data/nws-stations.txt: a text file listing each call or NWS
station like "SECIND" that you would like to transmit via RF)

Enable WX logging
Logs all weather data received from your weather station.


HELP-INDEX>Replaying a log

                              Replaying a log

Click on "File", then "Open Log File" and a file selector window will display.
You can use it to browse your hard drive and select any file containing raw
TNC data like those created by the TNC and Net logging options. Your station
will still function the same way, receiving and transmitting. If you were
logging data, the typical place to look for those files would be 
~/.xastir/logs/

HELP-INDEX>Locating a Station

                             Locating a Station

Click on "Stations", then "Find Station". A window will pop up. You can now
enter a call or part of a call. By default it will search for an exact match
(full call, not partial) and is not case sensitive. If you are looking for a
partial match, "Match Exact" should not be selected.

For objects which could contain lower case letters you have to check
"Match Case"! Opposite to the name, without "Match Case" the search
text will only be converted to upper case...

Clicking on the "Locate Now!" button will center the first station
found in the center of your screen at the current zoom level.
Clicking on "Cancel" will close the window.

HELP-INDEX>Creating and using Map Display Bookmarks

                  Creating and using Map Display Bookmarks

Click on "Maps", then "Map Display Bookmarks" and a window will pop up.
If this is the first time you have used this then the box will have no
entries in it. To add a bookmark to the list: Position the main map to
the area and zoom level you want to use. Enter a unique name in the
"New Name" area, then click on add. Your entry will be added to the
list (in alphabetical order).  You can add as many map display bookmarks
as you want. To use one of the bookmarks mark its name and click
"Activate!". The main map will then show the stored area and zoom level.
You can similarly delete a bookmark by clicking on the bookmark name and
then the "Delete" button.

"Maps->Locate Map Feature" is another method to jump to a location, if
the name of the location is known and you have GNIS files installed.

HELP-INDEX>Tracking a Station

                        Tracking a Station

Click on "Stations", then "Track Station". Enter the callsign to track (all or
part) then click on the "Track Now!" button. As the station moves it will
remain viewable in the main map window. As the stations starts to get close
to the edge of the map window the window will recenter so that the object is
always visible. To stop tracking this station click on the "Clear Tracking"
button. While tracking is active, a "Tr" is shown in the status bar next to
the zoom level.  If the station is not on the map yet, tracking will begin
as soon as it shows up.

HELP-INDEX>Configuring Interfaces

                           Configuring Interfaces

Click on Interfaces, then Properties.

An "Installed Interfaces" box should appear. This box will allow you to add,

HELP-INDEX>Configure Serial TNC Devices 

                          Configure Serial TNC Devices 

This section covers adding or modifying Serial TNC's or Serial TNC's with a
GPS on a HSP cable.

If you have a HSP cable, which allows you to share the TNC port with a GPS
unit you may choose a TNC with GPS (HSP Cable). This is a special cable and may
not work on all computers/GPS/TNC combinations. If you use this device the TNC
and the GPS should be set to the same communications parameters. Generally
4800 bps, 8 data bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit.

TNC Port Options:
Selecting "Activate on start up" will tell Xastir to look for this device and
set up communications with it when the program first starts.

Selecting "Allow Transmitting" will tell Xastir that any outgoing RF data can
be sent to this device for broadcast.

The TNC Port is the Unix device that the TNC (or TNC and GPS) is hooked to.
Normally you can use /dev/ttyS0 (com1), /dev/ttyS1 (com2) etc..

Now set the bps rate under port settings, and the parameters under port
style. Port Style setting 8N1 is used for 8 data bits, No parity and 1 stop
bit. 7E1 is used for 7 data bits, even parity and 1 stop bit. 7O1 is used for
7 data bits, odd parity, and 1 stop bit. These parameters must match your TNC
and GPS.

Choose the correct IGate operation for this device. You may have several TNC
devices, and this option can be different for each device. If you are not
running an IGate leave it at the default option of "Disable".

Enter up to three UNPROTO paths. Xastir will assume the XX VIA part of the
UNPROTO path. There are three paths allowed so that your signal will be heard
if conditions are bad. XASTIR will cycle through each one that is filled in,
one per transmission time.  If you are local to a digi, just a WIDE may be a
good choice. If you are using low power and/or are distant from a digi then
RELAY, WIDE may work better. Or if you know the call of your closest digi you
may use XXXCALL, WIDE. Most of you will only need one path. If you are in a
remote area and your signal is difficult to get out you may need more. Check
with a local group and ask what path may be best for your area.  Some areas
use the more efficient flooding protocols, in which case you might use WIDE3-3
or RELAY,WIDE3-3.

TNC Startup and Shutdown files. These fields specify a filename that is
located in the /usr/local/xastir/config directory. Each file is a standard
text file containing any commands you would like to send your TNC at the time
the device is activated (startup file) or shut down.

HELP-INDEX>Configure Serial TNC w/GPS on HSP cable or AUX port

                Configure Serial TNC w/GPS on HSP cable or AUX port

These hybrid interface types implement the options of both serial TNCs and
GPSs. Please consult the configuration help for both serial TNCs and serial
GPSs for further information on the configuration of this device.

HELP-INDEX>Configure AX.25 TNC Devices

                        Configure AX.25 TNC Devices

This section covers adding or modifying AX.25 TNC devices. AX.25 devices can
be any device that uses the Linux AX.25 drivers. This is a kernel level
driver, and device such as a Baycom or a sound modem can be used as a TNC.
These devices must be set up and running before Xastir can use them.

Selecting "Activate on start up" will tell Xastir to look for this device and
set up communications with it when the program first starts.

Selecting "Allow Transmitting" will tell Xastir that any outgoing RF data can
be sent to this device for broadcast.

Choose the correct IGate operation for this device. You may have several TNC
devices and this option can be different for each device. If you are not
running an IGate leave it at the default option of "Disable".

Enter the AX.25 Device name you specified in the axports file for this device.

Enter in up to three UNPROTO paths. Xastir will assume the XX VIA part of the
UNPROTO path. There are three paths allowed so that your signal will be heard
if conditions are bad. XASTIR will cycle through each one that is filled in,
one per transmission time.  If you are local to a digi, just a WIDE may be a
good choice. If you are using low power and/or are distant from a digi then
RELAY, WIDE may work better. Or if you know the call of your closest digi you
may use XXXCALL, WIDE. Most of you will only need one path. If you are in a
remote area and your signal is difficult to get out you may need more. Check
with a local group and ask what path may be best for your area.  Some areas
use the more efficient flooding protocols, in which case you might use WIDE3-3
or RELAY,WIDE3-3.

NOTE: To use AX.25 devices with Xastir you will need to run the program as
"root". If you want to run Xastir as another user you may want to set the
suid bit on the Xastir program file. Please see README.1ST for more
information; current Xastir drops the extra privileges but has not been audited
for exploits. Use in this fashion in a multi-user environment at your own risk!

HELP-INDEX>Configure Serial GPS Devices

                       Configure Serial GPS Devices

Set the serial port device for your GPS unit. Common values of /dev/ttyS0
(COM1) or /dev/ttyS1 (COM2) can be used.

Selecting "Activate on start up" will tell Xastir to look for this device and
set up communications with it when the program first starts.

Selecting "Set system clock from GPS data" will tell Xastir to try setting the
system's clock to the highly accurate time signal from the GPS receiver. This
requires root privileges on most systems.

Now set the bps rate under port settings, and the parameters under port
style. Port Style setting 8N1 is used for 8 data bits, No parity and 1 stop
bit. 7E1 is used for 7 data bits, even parity and 1 stop bit. 7O1 is used for
7 data bits, odd parity, and 1 stop bit. These parameters must match your GPS.
Most GPS units will use 4800 bps and 8,n,1.

HELP-INDEX>Configure Networked GPS Devices

                    Configure Networked GPS Devices

If you need to share the GPS data with different programs or machines, this
option is best. Xastir will work with gpsd which will allow several
connections to share your GPS data.

Set the host name (or IP address) and the port number for the gpsd host on
your network.

Selecting "Activate on start up" will tell Xastir to look for this device and
set up communications with it when the program first starts.

Selecting "Reconnect on failure" will tell Xastir to try to reconnect when the
data stream has failed.

Selecting "Set system clock from GPS data" will tell Xastir to try setting the
system's clock to the highly accurate time signal from the GPS receiver. This
requires root privileges on most systems.

HELP-INDEX>Configure the Internet Server

                         Configure the Internet Server

Internet Servers allow you to send and receive data for all over the world.

Selecting "Activate on start up" will tell Xastir to look for this device and
setup communications with it when the program first starts.

Selecting "Allow Transmitting" will tell Xastir that any outgoing Internet
data can be sent to this device.

Enter the host name (or IP address) and the port number of the Internet
Server you want to contact.  A list of possible servers is in README.1ST.

Enter a valid pass-code to validate your connection, this will allow your
data to be transmitted via an Igate. If you don't have a pass-code, use the 
included "callpass" program to generate one. Note that passcodes are dependent
on callsigns.  From the src directory, "make callpass" should create the
executable if it isn't already compiled.

Selecting "Reconnect on failure" will tell Xastir to try to reconnect when the
data stream has failed.

HELP-INDEX>Configure a Serial WX Station

                     Configure a Serial WX Station

Set the serial port device for your WX unit. Common values of /dev/ttyS0
(COM1) or /dev/ttyS1 (COM2) can be used.

Selecting "Activate on start up" will tell Xastir to look for this device and
set up communications with it when the program first starts.

Now set the bps rate under port settings, and the parameters under port
style. Port Style setting 8N1 is used for 8 data bits, No parity and 1 stop
bit. 7E1 is used for 7 data bits, even parity and 1 stop bit. 7O1 is used for
7 data bits, odd parity, and 1 stop bit. These parameters must match your WX
unit. The Data Type option will allow you to override what type of serial data
the program will look for. The auto-detect feature will first look for Weather
data in a binary type as the Radio Shack WX-200 uses. If no binary data is
found in the stream, Xastir will look for an ASCII type of WX station (like
Peet Bros.).

HELP-INDEX>Configure a Networked WX Station

                   Configure a Networked WX Station

Xastir can use WX data servers such as wx200d. wx200d will allow several
network connections, thus sharing the Weather data with several programs or
computers.

Enter the host name (or IP address) and the port number of the WX data server
you want to contact.

Selecting "Activate on start up" will tell Xastir to look for this device and
set up communications with it when the program first starts.

Selecting "Reconnect on failure" will tell Xastir to try to reconnect when the
data stream has failed.

As before the Data Type will override the auto detection.

HELP-INDEX>Printing

                       Printing the Map Screen

Xastir can print the drawing area in either black & white or color.  It does
this by first dumping the image to an XPixmap file on disk, then using external
tools to convert it to postscript, scale it, rotate it, preview it, then print
it.  You must have your system printing set up to handle postscript (usually
this requires Ghostscript and a print filter installed, as well as lp or lpr
print spoolers).  You must also have the following tools installed for this
capability:  ImageMagick tools (specifically "convert"), "Ghostscript",
Ghostscript fonts, and "gv".  Once all of these packages are installed and
functional, you should get a "gv" window popping up shortly after you tell
Xastir to create a print file.  From there  you can view the printed image, and
if acceptable, tell "gv" to print it.  Note that sometimes changing to a white
default background for the maps is recommended, depending on what maps you have
viewable.  This can save greatly on ink.

HELP-INDEX>Creating Snapshots

                     Creating Automatic Snapshots

Xastir has the capability to create automatic snapshots of the map screen
on a recurring basis.  This time period is currently set at once per five
minutes.  Assuming that you have "convert" from the ImageMagick tools
installed, Xastir will create an XPM format file in /var/tmp, then convert
it to the PNG file /var/tmp/xastir_snap.png.  This file is useful for putting
on web pages to show a live image of what is on your Xastir screen.  Enable
this feature via the "File->Enable PNG Snapshots" togglebutton.

These are the symbols that you can select for your station under the "Station
Information" configuration menu. The current list can be found in the APRS(tm)
Reference which you could get from http://www.tapr.org

HELP-INDEX>What was new in Xastir 1.0

Over the past year, Xastir has been under active development, and this new
release is the culmination of those efforts. Development has been run by
Chuck Byam, who agreed to take over for Frank Giannandrea. Many other
individuals have contributed to this project, and are listed in the AUTHORS
file.

The Xastir package now uses GNU autoconf to build makefiles and select
features based on the libraries and software one has installed. No more
editing makefiles as in previous releases!

Starting Xastir 1.0, one probably won't immediately notice any major
changes. The familiar interface of previous Xastir versions has been retained
for the most part. The great majority of the changes are improvements in
efficiency under the hood:
* Startup time for the program has been improved.
* Memory usage has greatly improved, with dynamic allocation of separate
  station, trail, and weather data on an as-needed basis. No longer will
  memory be wasted on stationary stations for trail data, nor will non-weather
  stations waste memory for weather information. With these modifications,
  Xastir can even be connected to the internet link comfortably on a 16mb
  machine.
* Improvements have been made to avoid having to reload maps from disk at every
  minor change; Weather alerts and changes to the display and tracking options
  no longer cause the maps to reload, rather the trails and symbols are
  redrawn alone.
* Improvements have been made to various dialog boxes that re-drew often, to
  redraw less often, to allow them to be usable on slower systems. This is
  also true of tracking a station, with the map redrawing only if the station
  approaches the edge of the screen.
Thanks to these changes, Xastir is perfectly usable on slower Pentium(tm)
machines.

Native GeoTIFF support is now included, and will be compiled into one's copy
of Xastir if they have the GeoTIFF libraries installed on their system. These
map files are of very high quality, and are especially useful in search and
rescue operations. Maps on this format are available from the USGS, and
commercially on CD-ROM. Xastir understands how to convert from the NAD-27
datum to the new WGS-84 datum, so maps of both format can be read accurately.
New shortcut buttons have been added to the map selection dialog to enable
one to pick all maps of a specific type.

Support for the Festival Speech Synthesis System is now available to announce
new stations and band openings. The old system of alert sounds has been
retained as well.

Xastir now supports adding and deleting objects. Finally, Xastir users are able
to manage resources with this useful feature. Objects are helpful for
coordinating events, directing travelers, and doing search and rescue work.

The County Warning Area maps that display weather alerts are no longer painted
onto the maps below, but are shaded onto the maps. While this does make the
colors unpredictable, it is now possible to see the road-maps below the 
alert! 

A new and useful feature is the change in the orientation of a symbol based on
the direction in which it is moving. Even without a trail, a quick glance can
tell you a mobile station's bearing. There are several more new options in the
display menu, enabling one to decide more precisely what is displayed and what
isn't.

Panning and control over the map has been enhanced: There are now arrow buttons
visible at the top of the screen to pan the map. The map can also be panned
with the arrow keys, and the zoom can be adjusted with the page up and page
down keys. There are new option in the click menu, to center the map where you
clicked or to place an object where you clicked. The panning options in this
menu have been removed in favor of the new controls at the top of the screen.

Support for altnet has been added, enabling one to have a private APRS(tm)
network for special events, search and rescue, storm chasing, or whenever else
the user doesn't want to be bothered by the hundreds of APRS(tm) stations
around.

There are numerous small changes, both visible and invisible to the user. The
interface control dialog now has a "Start all" and "Stop all" option, to save
the user the time of performing these actions for each interface. The station
setup dialog now shows you your symbol, so you don't have to exit the dialog to
see which symbol you chose. Several buffer overflows that caused unpredictable
behavior and/or crashes have been fixed. And many minor improvements have been
made to the source code to ensure that it compiles correctly on various
systems.

Enjoy the new Xastir!
