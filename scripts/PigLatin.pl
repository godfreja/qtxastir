# This is a wrapper script around a regex found here:
#   <http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=3586>
#
# Run it like this:
#
#   cd xastir/config
#   ../scripts/PigLatin.pl <language-English.sys >language-PigLatin.sys
#
# If you would like, replace the language-English.sys file in the
# destination directory (usually "/usr/local/share/xastir/config")
# with this new file (renaming it to "language-English.sys" of
# course), then restart Xastir and you'll have it displaying in Pig
# Latin!
