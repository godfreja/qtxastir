# This is an example script used by one of the developers to ease
# the workload.  It's not intended to be used by the general
# userbase.  It's included with the Xastir sources so that it
# doesn't get lost if the developer should suddenly drop out of
# sight.


# To remove the RELEASE tag from only one deleted file in the Attic:
# "cvs rtag -d -a RELEASE xastir/src/db.h"



# Clear the STABLE tag from all files including files in the Attic
# (deleted files):
export CVS_RSH=ssh; cvs rtag -a STABLE xastir

# Assign the STABLE tag to the latest revisions:
export CVS_RSH=ssh; cvs tag -F STABLE
