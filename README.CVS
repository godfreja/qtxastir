CVS Instructions:
-----------------
     For those who think CVS might be a bit too complicated to deal with,
     here are (I think) the minimal commands.  See the "SUDO" section
     below though for ideas on how to make updating Xastir even simpler.

     Initial CVS Checkout:
     ---------------------
     1) Create a ".cvsrc" file in your home directory containing the
        following lines.  Use whatever Unix-type editor you're
        comfortable with.  Choices might be pico, vi, emacs, others:

         ##cvs -z3
         update -P -d
         status -v
         diff -u

        These are just some of the CVS options that I prefer, and make some
        things easier.  They are not required.

        The "cvs -z3" option isn't accepted by SourceForge currently.  Comment
        it out by adding a couple of '#' marks in front of the line.  You can
        test it at a later date by removing the '#' marks and trying a cvs
        command.

     2) Start up a shell window of some type, perhaps an xterm or an rxvt.
        Type the following commands into this one shell.  You'll be setting
        an environment variable which will then allow you check out the full
        sources for the first time.  After that, the environment variable
        won't be needed anymore and all shells you use will be able to
        work with the remote CVS repository.  The checked-out sources contain
        administration info which the CVS commands use to know which remote
        server to talk to, and which account/encrypted password to use from
        your ~/.cvspass file.

     3) Follow the instructions listed under "Anonymous CVS Access".  Go to:
        <http://sourceforge.net/projects/xastir/>, then click on "CVS" to
        find the instructions.

        For those that are Internet-challenged, here are the two commands,
        customized for the Xastir project:

          cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@xastir.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xastir login

        Press the <ENTER> key when it asks you for a password.  That creates
        a ".cvspass" file in your home directory with the anonymous login
        information inside it.

          cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@xastir.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xastir co xastir

        That creates a subdirectory called "xastir" that has all the latest
        sources in it.

     You may want to use this instead, to get the sources corresponding to the
     latest release:

       cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@xastir.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xastir co -r RELEASE xastir

     or use this line to get the latest version deemed "stable" by the developers
     (generally newer than the RELEASE version):

       cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@xastir.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xastir co -r STABLE xastir

     All done!  You now have the latest development sources on your computer.
     Now you can forget about all of the previous instructions unless you
     delete the entire tree and want to start over from scratch.

     Note that if you choose the "RELEASE" or "STABLE" tags, those tags will
     become sticky, so that "cvs update" commands will update to the latest
     versions of files containing those tags.  If you wish to remove this
     sticky option so that you can synchronize to a different tag or the latest
     developer's CVS, see the "cvs update -A" command below.


     CVS Commands for Maintaining the Current Development Sources:
     -------------------------------------------------------------
     Once all this is in place, just cd into the "xastir" directory at any
     time, type "cvs update", then type "make install" and you'll have the
     latest development stuff installed on your system.

     Here are the commands to do if you want a clean build of the latest
     sources, and want configure to recheck all the libraries and header
     files that Xastir needs:

         cd xastir
         cvs update (snag all the latest changes)
         ./bootstrap.sh
         ./configure
         (make clean;make -j3 2>&1) | tee make.log
         su
         make install (make install-strip can be used after the first time,
                       it removes debugging info from executable)
         chmod 4555 /usr/local/bin/xastir (only needed if using kernel AX.25)
         exit (from root)
         xastir

     Note that you'll need autoconf 2.53 or newer and automake 1.6.3 or newer
     in order to run the "./bootstrap.sh" script.

     For the "cvs update" line, you can also choose which version to update to,
     just like the "cvs co" lines shown above:

       cvs update -r RELEASE
     or
       cvs update -r STABLE

     Once you specify a revision tag (RELEASE or STABLE), that option becomes
     "sticky" for future checkouts and updates.  That means you only need to
     type "cvs update" in order to update your code to the latest sources
     containing that tag.

       cvs update -A

     will make the cvs update command track to the most recently submitted
     versions again (will make the RELEASE or STABLE options un-sticky).  To
     review:

       cvs update -A            # To get to developers sources.
       cvs update -r STABLE     # To get to latest stable sources.
       cvs update -r RELEASE    # To get to latest released sources.


     Even more CVS commands (most people won't need these):
     ------------------------------------------------------
     I use these aliases the most (defined in my bash shell startup files):

       alias cvsdiff='cvs diff -w -r HEAD'
       alias cvsstat2='cvs -n -q update'
       alias cvsstat3='(cvs status 2>&1) | grep -E "Status: | Examining" | grep -v Up-to-date | grep -v Makefile.in'

     to see if anything has changed.  cvsstat3 is the most useful one
     for me as a developer.  If anything has, I can use this alias to
     see the details on a particular file:

         alias cvsdiff='cvs diff -w -r HEAD'

     As in:

         cvsdiff main.c

         -or- (not using the alias)

         cvs diff -w -r HEAD main.c

     Then perhaps do an update on that file alone:

         cvs update main.c


    Checking out a branch (for anonymous-CVS users):
    ------------------------------------------------

        Go to a new directory structure (not CVS controlled) and type this:

            export CVS_RSH=ssh
            mkdir <branchname>
            cd <branchname>
            cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@xastir.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xastir login

        Press the <ENTER> key when it asks for your password, then:

            cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@xastir.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xastir co -r <branchname> xastir

        The above command will create a directory "xastir" in the <branchname>
        directory containing the latest sources from that branch.  For example:

            /home/<user>/src/<branchname>/xastir/


 
     There are many more CVS commands and options.  Many of them are more
     of use to the developers than the users, some of those are listed below.
     The above should be enough for most people to keep their copies in sync
     with the latest CVS development sources.


SUDO Instructions:
------------------

    "sudo" is a command that can make your life much simpler.  After you set
    it up that is!  By adding a couple of lines to your /etc/sudoers file
    (using the "visudo" command to edit this file), you'll be able to run a few
    commands as root without having to type the root password each time.
    Another thing you can do at that point is automate the entire
    "cvs update;./configure;su;make install" process via a script.  Here's how
    to set all of this up:

    Type "su" to become the root user, then type "visudo".  This will bring up
    the "vi" editor on the /etc/sudoers file.  If you'd like to learn more
    about what I'm going to describe, type "man sudoers" in another window and
    read about this file.  Another man-page that is useful here is the "man
    sudo" page.

    Back to the editing:  There's a section in there for user alias.  Mine is
    labeled "# User alias specification".  Add a line there that reads like
    this:

        User_Alias XASTIR = username1, username2, username3

    where username1, etc, are valid usernames that you wish to be able to do
    Xastir installs.  For instance you might have:

        User_Alias XASTIR = mikey

    Next, add a line near the bottom that reads like this:

        XASTIR ALL = NOPASSWD: /bin/chmod, /usr/bin/make

    Now write out and close the file.  At this point the "mikey" user will have
    root permissions when he/she runs the commands "/bin/chmod" or
    "/usr/bin/make".  Make sure the paths to those programs are correct for
    your system.

    Exit from "su" so that you're a regular (non-root) user again.

    Now, in the "xastir" source directory (mine is in "~/src/xastir"), create a
    script that reads like this.  I named my script  "update-xastir" but nearly
    any name for the script will do:
 
    -----------------cut here--------------------
        #! /bin/sh

        cvs update
        ./bootstrap.sh
        ./configure
        sudo make clean
        sudo make install
        sudo chmod 4755 /usr/local/bin/xastir
    -----------------cut here--------------------

    Now type "chmod u+rwx update-xastir" to make that script executable.

    Actually, we've just created a script for Xastir that implements the above
    and called it "update-xastir".  Do a "cvs update" to get it.

    Try out the script.  Type:

        ./update-xastir

    It should run through the entire update/configure/make/install process for
    Xastir.  Remember to either change to the proper xastir directory before
    running it, or add a "cd" command at the beginning of the script so that it
    will run in the proper directory in all cases.  If you add the proper "cd"
    command you can copy the script to /usr/local/bin and then run it as
    "update-xastir" from anywhere.

    Windows users:  You may need to remove the "sudo" keyword on each line to
    have it work properly for you.

    A note from Gerry Creager as to another way to set up the sudoers file:

      "I now consider it a good idea to add the "gifted" users to the 'wheel'
      group and then solely enable wheel in /etc/sudoers; I've seen a recent
      article also supporting this."


Developer's CVS Instructions:
-----------------------------

    Read this doc first.  Why did they have to put spaces in the URL???:

        http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/CVS%20client%20instructions

    For branching/merging, read these as well:

        http://www.drdobbs.com/programmers-toolchest/184404280


    Checking out the trunk (main branch, also known as "HEAD"):
    -----------------------------------------------------------

        export CVS_RSH=ssh
        cvs -z3 -d:ext:<devel>@xastir.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xastir co xastir

    The above command will create a directory "xastir" in your current directory which
    contains the latest Xastir sources.  Replace "<devel>" with your Sourceforge
    developer's login name.


    Creating a branch:
    ------------------

    NOTE:  This is a special operation.  Do not attempt unless you are familiar with
    CVS tagging, branches, and merging.  We plan to do development on the trunk for
    the mainline code, and use branches only for a few special development bits:
    Experimental code that we're not sure will make it to production, or porting to
    a new widget set for instance...  Something that might be a dead-end or something
    that might not see the light of day for some time.

    In a checked-out CVS copy of Xastir, first make sure your working copy is
    up-to-date ("cvs -nq update"), then:

        cvs tag -c branchname_0                 # Creates a tag called "branchname_0"
        cvs tag -r branchname_0 -b branchname   # Creates branch "branchname" starting at the tag "branchname_0"

    Replace "branchname_0" with a tag of your choosing, and "branchname" with a
    branch name of your choosing.  For instance I may use a tag of:

        B_xastir_qt_0

    and a branch name of:

        B_xastir_qt

NOTE:  Use "B_" as a prefix on all of our branches and branch-tags so that we can
    recognize them easily when presented with a full list of tags.

    Follow the "Checking out a branch" section below to create a NEW directory area to
    work on the branch.

    A suggested organization (directory names), to keep everything separate:

        /home/<user>/src/xastir/head/           # Trunk (or HEAD), mainline development
        /home/<user>/src/xastir/branchname1/    # branchname1 development
        /home/<user>/src/xastir/branchname2/    # branchname2 development

    Then perform these commands to check out the branch into your new clean
    directory:

        cd xastir/branchname
        cvs co -r branchname xastir     # Fetch the branch code

    After you do the "co" command, the "-r" option is sticky on all the
    files in the tree, so any cvs commits there will commit to the new branch
    instead of the trunk.  Pay attention to your directory structure from that
    point on:  It's important to know whether you're making changes on a branch
    or on the trunk, and where commits will be made to.

    It is recommended to immediately create another tag after the above steps are
    complete and before any files/directories get changed.  This helps with merging
    between the branch and the trunk later:

        cvs tag -c branchname_start # Creates a tag called "branchname_start"

NOTE:  Use "T_START_" as a prefix for this start tag of a new branch to make them
    easily recognizable.  For instance:

        T_START_xastir_qt


    Checking out a branch:
    ----------------------

    To check out a branch to a fresh directory:

        mkdir <branchname>  # I choose /home/<user>/src/xastir/branchname/ for a directory
        cd <branchname>
        cvs -z3 -d:ext:<devel>@xastir.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xastir co -r <branchname> xastir

    The above command will create a directory "xastir" under the <branchname> directory,
    containing the sources from the branch you specified.  The selected branch will remain
    "sticky" in your checked-out working directory unless/until you override it
    via additional CVS commands.

    Replace "<devel>" above with your Sourceforge developer's login name and
    "<branchname>" with the name of the branch you're trying to check out.

    One you've created a branch, pay attention to whether you're working on a checked-out
    copy of a branch or a checked-out copy of the trunk, and commit responsibly.  Anything
    you commit to a branch will not appear on the trunk, and vice-versa, unless a merge
    between the two is done at a later date (in either direction).  The trunk has version
    numbers like "dd.dd", while branches have version numbers like "dd.dd.dd.dd".

    You should also be able to run the "cvs status <filename>" command and look at
    the "Sticky Tag" near the top of the listing to see which branch you're working with:

        cvs status README.CVS | head -15


    Listing the tags on a file:
    ---------------------------
    
    cvs log -t README.CVS


    Merging between trunk and a branch:
    -----------------------------------
    TBD.

    A note from Tom regarding merges:  Use the "-kk" option on all merges, otherwise every
    file that has "$Revision: 1.28 $" or "$Date: 2012/11/13 23:53:39 $" in it will get flagged as a chnage -- possibly
    even a conflict -- even if that's the only difference between branch and head.  "-kk"
    on a cvs update doesn't do substitution on those tags, and so only files with real
    changes will get updated.
