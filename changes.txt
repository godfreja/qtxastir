* fixes/additions by KE4NFJ

 added wx gust reset.
 removed some filtering on AX.25 ports.@
 fixed data command/transmission problem for some TNCs.
 changed the default code compiling to not include debugging information,
     this reduces the executable code size by a huge amount. However I also
     added an option in the Makefile to compile with this information.
 changed Segmentation faults operation, if the program Segfaults, it will
     terminate, but now it should happen cleaner.

 added compressed object decoding.
 added course and speed to compressed decoding.
 added logic to AX.25 interface so a "*" would be added to the 
       digipeater call that's transmitting the packet.@ 
 fixed bug in AX.25 interface, seems as if all AX.25 packet data is transmitted through
       the interface. Even if it is from a device not used by Xastir. Added code to 
       "filter out" incoming packets that are from another device. @
 fixed tab groups for keyboard movement on message boxes, tracking, locate station, and misc dialogs.
 removed transmitter off message popups, some found this annoying.

 fixed bug in WX data output, rain in past 24hr was switched with rain since midnight
       on output of data.
 fixed a possible crash on shutdown of the network connections. 
 added/fixed max station now only has a memory limit. The station buffer now allocates memory
       as needed and the max station's error popup will only show when no more memory can be
       allocated for stations.*

08/17/1999 Alpha 0.1.0

 Do not use Lesstif version 0.88.9! It makes the use of radio buttons
 crash the program. Not sure why.. perhaps a bug in this version of
 Lesstif?!  

 Ok first official canning of Alpha characters in the version numbers,
 This would have been 0.0.Kt4, but it gets too confusing. From now on,
 test versions, for that matter any version will be numeric digits only
 and no special tX on the end for test versions. Trying to keep it simple.

 added decoding for Peet Bros UM2.
 fixed some bugs in displaying temp on the station info screen.
 added sound alerts for messages.

 added PHG to station info.
 fixed hear via TNC statement in station info..
 added decoding for Peet Bros. data logging mode record format for over air data.

 Internet, That will allow you to reconnect to the net if this option is 
 checked.

 Changed, The messaging system is going through an overhaul, hopefully not
 so much of a kludge.

06/02/1999 Alpha 0.0.J

 Major bug fixes for Red Hat users.. I hope I got them all..


06/01/1999 Alpha 0.0.I

 First release of Xastir!

Lots of things are not working.. No station information windows. It doesn't
decode all of the APRS(tm) packets. Messaging works, however it is not 
finished. Currently there is no support for GPS data for setting your position.

Xastir will read window/mac APRS(tm) map format and automatically select the
correct map for your area win auto maps on. Currently this is slow and will
be corrected in future versions. Most of the APRS(tm) are in place and will
position on the map. Net interface is live, but also needs more work.
Configuration screens are very basic.. In other words it is the first release
of FREE Alpha version software!






APRS(tm) is a Trademark of Bob Bruninga,
