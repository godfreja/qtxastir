# This dbfawk file is used to map arbitrary dbf data that accompanies
# a shapefile into Xastir canoncical values of:
#   key     - search key
#   lanes   - width of feature (usually a road but applies to rivers, etc. too)
#   color   - color to draw the road
#   name    - name of the road for labels
#   filled  - whether a polygon is drawn filled or not
#   pattern - line pattern for road, river, etc.
#   display_level - highest zoom level at which to display the feature
#   label_level - highest zoom level at which to display the label
#   symbol  - 3 char 'TIO': table, ID, overlay
#
# NOTE: This file format is modeled after awk but is nowhere near awk
#  compatible.
#
# This file is used to map NWS county warning area polygon shapefiles
# which are named w_ddmmyy.dbf.  These are used for WX alerts.
# For the WX alert feature, the key is set to the CWA code
# reformated to match alert->title.  For example: CW_ATAE for CWA TAE.

# BEGIN is called once per dbf file which contains multiple records.
BEGIN {
# dbfinfo is the "signature" of the dbf file listing the column names in order.
# dbfinfo should match the dbf file that we say this dbfawk file goes with.

# dbffields is which of the above fields we actually want to look at.
# Note that the order we list these is important since we are appending the
# word County or Parish depending on what state the county is in.

# BEGIN_RECORD is called once per dbf record which contains multiple fields.
# Use this rule to re-initialize variables between records.
