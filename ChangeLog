2006-11-16 17:12  we7u

	* Makefile.am (1.41): Getting rid of the symlink I recently added
	  which pointed from /usr/local/share/xastir/doc to
	  /usr/local/doc/xastir.  Near as I can tell we're fairly well
	  FHS-compliant now with Xastir.

2006-11-15 20:11  we7u

	* Makefile.am (1.40): Forcing the removal of the old
	  $prefix/share/xastir/doc directory and creating a symlink to the new
	  location.

2006-11-15 19:49  we7u

	* Makefile.am (1.39), xastir-min.spec.in (1.4), xastir.spec.in
	  (1.25): Moving the doc files to an FHS-compliant directory.  For
	  a user installing from sources they'll get installed in
	  "/usr/local/share/doc/xastir/" instead of the old location of
	  "/usr/local/share/xastir/doc".

2006-11-15 16:45  we7u

	* Makefile.am (1.38), xastir-min.spec.in (1.3), xastir.spec.in
	  (1.24): Changing the man page directory from $prefix/man to
	  $prefix/share/man, per FHS-2.3 and LSB-3.1

2006-11-15 15:50  we7u

	* xastir-min.spec.in (1.2): Changing "--without-shapelib" to
	  "--with-internal-shapelib" to take adantage of the new shapelib
	  library we include with Xastir.

2006-11-15 15:48  we7u

	* .cvsignore (1.5): Adding two derived files back in.

2006-11-15 15:47  we7u

	* xastir-min.spec (1.2), xastir.spec (1.2): Put these files into
	  CVS by mistake.  They are derived files.  Silly me.

2006-11-15 15:08  we7u

	* .cvsignore (1.4): Updating for current list of files.

2006-11-15 15:07  we7u

	* xastir-min.spec (1.1), xastir.spec (1.1): Adding the spec files
	  that I've been using.  I'm surprised that they weren't added before,
	  but I had added them to my .cvsignore file and so didn't notice.

2006-11-14 20:58  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started (1.30): Adding missing command-line
	  options to the docs.

2006-11-14 19:52  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.157): Fixing up the Shapelib config options.

2006-11-14 19:52  we7u

	* xastir.1 (1.13): Updating the man page a bit.

2006-11-14 16:28  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.156): Changes to make it obvious in the configure
	  output text and in Help->About that we're using the internal
	  Shapelib.  This change doesn't affect summary.log.

2006-11-14 08:19  tvrusso

	* configure.ac (1.155): Fix the "-I" flag in CPPFLAGS when local
	  shapelib is being built.

	  As it was, the compiler would not find the local shapefil.h file
	  unless you were building in the actual xastir source code directory,
	  or if shapefil.h was already installed system-wide.

	  Noticed this while attempting a fresh build on a brand new laptop,
	  on which I'd decided to attempt the simplest possible build, with no
	  shapelib installed.

2006-11-13 19:46  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started (1.29): Added notes about the private copy
	  of Shapelib and when it might be used, the "wget" requirement for
	  the get-NWSdata script, putting in a callsign when initially
	  starting Xastir, and a list of various places to get Xastir help.

2006-11-13 19:43  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.138): Mentioning the private Shapelib version and
	  when it might be used.

2006-11-13 19:43  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.86): Mentioning "wget" as a requirement for
	  get-NWSdata.  Mentioning the private install of Shapelib.

2006-11-13 19:41  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.89): Adding info about the alternate method of getting
	  Shapefile support.

2006-11-13 15:10  tvrusso

	* README.Contributing (1.14): Fix up a mistake in the description
	  of "build directories", and add a reference to that technique to an
	  earlier section that advocates doing all the builds in the source
	  directory.

	  Build directories are such a powerful tool for developers, we should
	  make sure we recommend it when talking about doing multiple builds.

2006-11-13 14:56  tvrusso

	* README.win32 (1.137): Attach a date to qualify the meaning of
	  "latest" in the ImageMagick section.

2006-11-13 14:25  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.136): Updating the description for ImageMagick
	  bug.

2006-11-12 00:11  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.85): Adding attribution for the default map.

2006-11-11 23:46  tvrusso

	* configure.ac (1.154): Add EXTRA_DIST and DIST_SUBDIRS lines so
	  that the shapelib stuff is properly bundled when doing a "make dist"
	  for release.

	  The Makefile.am in the contrib directory does not actually build any
	  of the contrib codes.  That's another step for another moment.  I
	  just wanted to make sure that any make dist that is done is sure to
	  bundle the entire shapelib directory in order to comply with the
	  terms of the license.

	  The "Makefile_orig" script in the shapelib/contrib directory could
	  be used temporarily to build the shapelib tools.  Ultimately, they
	  could be built by the new makefile, but it's not really the goal of
	  this exercise to do all that.  In fact, at some point it might be
	  reasonable for xastir's shapelib directory to contain only the files
	  needed for building the library, but that will probably require
	  modifying it to be under GPL instead of LGPL.  That's just a matter
	  of editing some license files, not any code.

	  Also, removed the shprewind file from the shapelib directory.  This
	  is a linux binary that for some reason was in the shapelib source
	  tarball I had.  It should never have been added to xastir's CVS
	  repository.

2006-11-11 23:01  we7u

	* Makefile.am (1.37): Adding a default map to the distribution.

2006-11-11 22:51  we7u

	* worldhi.map (1.1): Adding a default map.  Map was created by
	  Keith Sproul, WU2Z, and used with his permission.

2006-11-10 21:48  tvrusso

	* configure.ac (1.153): Add shapelib as an internal library, and
	  use it if we don't find an external one.

	  Make a loud warning if we do so, because the result of this is that
	  we'll have a bigger executable.

	  This commit is bigger than it needs to be, because it includes all
	  of shapelib, including the contrib directory.

	  Added an automake-generated Makefile for this thing.

	  Builds only a static library, and calls it "libshape.a" instead of
	  "libshp.a" so that if we use ask to use the static one while there
	  is also an external one installed, the linker doesn't pull in the
	  shared library one unbidden.

	  This stuff can be tested on a system with libshp installed by
	  configuring with "--without-shapelib"

	  I will be removing Makefile.in because it's not supposed to be in
	  CVS.  My mistake.

2006-11-06 01:16  tvrusso

	* README.win32 (1.135): Add information about problems with Cygwin
	  ImageMagick.  The notes in the README.win32 refer to "recent
	  versions" of cygwin containing ImageMagick 5.5.7, which is very
	  outdated.  Current versions of Cygwin come with 6.0.4, and there are
	  real problems due to that version being linked with Display
	  Postscript support --- X.org stopped supporting that, and now
	  ImageMagick doesn't work on Cygwin unless you find a few DLLs off
	  the net.

	  The paragraph I added here points the user at an article that
	  explains the issue and shows two workarounds (installing the DLLs or
	  building ImageMagick from source code instead).

2006-11-02 16:03  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.152): Setting up for the next development source
	  version number.

2006-11-02 14:43  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.151): Setting up to do the 1.8.4 release.

2006-10-25 15:16  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.19): Lining up the line to match the rest.

2006-10-24 18:03  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.18): Adding another test which disables the
	  /usr/include/magick/ directory before attempting a compile.  This
	  disables ImageMagick.

2006-09-15 16:53  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.88): A tweak by Chip, N1MIE.

2006-08-14 18:01  we7u

	* FAQ (1.68): Added another bit to the "remote restart" section.

2006-08-14 12:24  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.87): Adding an invocation line for gprof that I use so
	  I don't need to figure it out each time.

2006-07-14 18:50  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started (1.28), xastir.1 (1.12): Updates by Dan
	  Brown, n8ysz.

2006-07-12 17:47  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.84): Updating the text for NWS Shapefile names to
	  match the NOAA website.

2006-07-11 16:06  tvrusso

	* WMSRadar.geo (1.8): Tweak transparency value.  For some time now,
	  the actual "no reflection" value that's been coming in has been hex
	  value  0x010101, not "0x000000".  On 24-bit displays that means that
	  the default file was displaying with an opaque nearly-black
	  background instead of a transparent one.

	  The actual no-reflection value returned by the WMS server has
	  changed back and forth between 0x000000 and 0x010101 often in the
	  history of the WMSRadar file and will probably need to be changed
	  again some time in the future.  It has been pretty consistently
	  0x010101 for several weeks now.

2006-07-07 16:10  we7u

	* README.Contributing (1.13): Added a section by Dan Brown.

2006-06-12 16:17  we7u

	* FAQ (1.67): Added "socat" to the FAQ.

2006-06-07 14:03  tvrusso

	* FAQ (1.66): Update pointer to latest version of the FAQ.  The
	  URLs that were here were very outdated.

2006-06-05 19:19  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.150): Bumping revision for devel to 1.8.3.

2006-06-05 18:50  we7u

	  release.

2006-06-05 17:14  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.83): Added a section describing how to create your

	  look for it in the scripts directory.

2006-06-01 16:35  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.81): Added a blurb about National Geographic's
	  Topo, TPO/TPG files, mapXchange, gpsbabel, and gpx2shape.pl.

2006-06-01 14:17  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.80): A bit added by Kyle Kienapfel regarding the
	  Canada topo file.  Thanks!

2006-05-12 20:32  tvrusso

	* FAQ (1.65): Add command for converting Root files to new scheme.

	  Of course, if someone could check this file out to see the commands,
	  they've already done the conversion...

2006-05-12 20:03  we7u

	* install-xastir (1.6): Updating to the latest SourceForge CVS
	  server names.

2006-03-10 16:16  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.75): Adding a section about using gdal_translate
	  to convert crappy geoTIFF's to usable ones.  Thanks to Tom Russo for
	  the info on how to do this.

2006-03-10 16:15  we7u

	  section.

2006-02-10 20:27  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.17), configure.ac (1.148): Tweaks to add more
	  regression tests and format the output so that it's easier to read.

2006-02-10 19:13  tvrusso

	* README.Contributing (1.11): Add a section on using separate
	  "build directories" to maintain specialized builds rather than
	  building in the source tree.

2006-02-09 23:14  tvrusso

	* README.Contributing (1.10): Change commentary on how to do
	  debugging builds.

2006-02-09 22:32  we7u

	* README.Contributing (1.9): Adding a debugging note from Tom
	  Russo.

2006-02-09 21:27  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.56): Change XASTIR_COMPILER_FLAGS so that it
	  doesn't insert "-g -O2" unconditionally.  That is unnecessary since
	  we call AC_PROG_CC, which *conditionally* inserts "-g -O2" into
	  CFLAGS if the user hasn't specified CFLAGS on the configure line.

	  This should allow users to build specialized debugging versions such
	  as ./configure CFLAGS="-O -g -fno-inline" and not have configure
	  stick a "-O2" in unbidden.

2006-02-07 02:33  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.81), README.Getting-Started (1.26), UPGRADE (1.13),

2006-02-02 16:49  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started (1.25): Reversing the meaning of the "-t"
	  command-line flag:  The segfault handler is now turned off by
	  default (meaning we'll dump core instead).  The "-t" flag turns on
	  the internal segfault handler now instead of disabling it.

2006-02-02 16:04  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.147): Commenting out the code that removed the
	  "-g" GCC option.  As Tom pointed out, it was a bad idea.

2006-02-01 16:42  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.55): Patching the search list for Berkely DB
	  library by adding 4.3 and 4.4 search paths.

2006-01-30 15:31  tvrusso

	* configure.ac (1.146): "roundf", recently used in maps.c, is a
	  newer extension that is not present in systems that still have old C
	  compilers.

	  Insert a check for roundf, and a workaround for systems that don't
	  support it.

2006-01-28 19:21  we7u

	* NWS-TEST.log (1.4): Moved one OR alert over to the coast and made
	  it blue, to stand out more against the other alerts.

2005-11-22 20:35  we7u

	* NWS-TEST.log (1.3): Moving all of the tests to the Northwest
	  region so we don't have to look all over the country for them.

2005-11-22 19:57  we7u

	  this tweak.

2005-10-20 17:21  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.64): Fix submitted by A. Carver for FCC database

2005-10-17 18:47  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.76): Tweaking formatting of -l language notes.

2005-10-14 15:11  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.125): Added a note about running configure from
	  an xterm so that "gv" support will be compiled in.  If run from a
	  non-X11 window, "gv" configure test fails.

2005-09-30 14:44  tvrusso

	* DEBUG_LEVELS (1.12): Change statement that the highest debug
	  level is 2047 to 4095.  There is now a debug level of 2048 (ALOHA
	  calculation and multipoint object debugging).

2005-09-30 14:27  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.75): Updating the docs regarding TCP and UDP server
	  ports.

2005-09-29 18:00  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.52): Fix by  Thorsten Lockert.  Fixes a problem
	  on MacOSX where -lgdal can have revision numbers after it.  Without
	  this fix the test compile using gdal fails.

2005-09-21 00:35  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.51): Restructure test for gv slightly, so that
	  AC_PATH_PROG is called first, and version is tested if gv is found.
	  The case where gv is found, but `gv -v | cut -d ' ' -f 1` not being
	  "gv" is in fact a sign of error that needs to be reported in a
	  meaningful way.

	  Turns out that when I do my normal cygwin build (which is usually
	  done in a non-X cygwin run to save memory), the old way of probing
	  gv found the gv executable, but because "gv -v" tries to connect to
	  the X server and reports failure if it can't, configure was telling
	  me that gv was found, but the build would actually happen without
	  gv.  This was quite confusing.

	  With the new test as committed here, I still can't build with gv
	  outside of an xterm on cygwin, but the reason actually shows up in
	  the configure output.

2005-09-08 16:49  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.74): Adding a blurb about conflicts between GDAL
	  internal libraries and external libraries that Xastir can use.

2005-09-08 16:39  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.50): Move -lgdal to end of LIBS line if it's
	  found.

	  It is possible for gdal to be using its own internal geotiff
	  library, and this can interfere with use of an external one in
	  xastir.  Having it later in the line than geotiff can fix that.

	  This could cause problems for systems with busted linkers that need
	  gdal to be earlier than everything it depends on.  If that happens,
	  it might be necessary to add the contents of "gdal-config
	  --dep-libs" to LIBS after -lgdal.

2005-09-03 01:42  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.49): More appropriate output for the case where
	  gv is not found by configure.

2005-09-02 23:00  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.48): Adding a clause for the case where no usable
	  "gv" is found.

2005-09-02 22:34  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.47): Another stab at trying to do the "gv"
	  revision tests.

2005-09-02 20:54  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.46): Tweaks to hopefully determine automatically
	  which version of "gv" is being used and change the code to
	  correspond to the proper API.

2005-09-01 17:00  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started (1.21): Modified the note regarding
	  geocode files.

2005-09-01 15:08  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.137): Adding a test for sigignore() to
	  configure.ac, and code to use it in main.c.  We were getting a
	  warning under Solaris by using signal() with SIG_IGN as the
	  parameter.

2005-08-31 21:42  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.11): Blowing away the autom4te.cache
	  directory at the start of each run, to make sure that we start out
	  ultra-clean.

2005-08-31 16:59  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.136): Attempt to remove "-no-unused" from linking
	  stage for Cygwin builds, as GCC links to complain about that flag
	  during linking.

2005-08-30 21:19  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.45): Changing grep syntax so that it will work
	  with non-GNU grep (Solaris).  Getting rid of dash near the end.

2005-08-26 21:12  tvrusso

	* configure.ac (1.135): Fix so that hostname.c can compile on
	  systems that define neither sighandler_t nor sig_t.  This is
	  necessary because of the new cast to sighandler_t of the second
	  argument of signal() that was put there to shut gcc warnings up.

2005-08-25 21:29  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.44): Getting rid of some extra restores of
	  variables that I shouldn't have added last go-around.

2005-08-25 20:48  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.43): Summary text and summary.log were incorrect
	  if gdal wasn't found.  Fixed.

2005-08-24 04:08  tvrusso

	* configure.ac (1.134): Change logic for deciding when to use a
	  sigjmp_buf vs. a jmp_buf.

	  The code that was originally here would only work if sigjmp_buf was
	  a #define, but on some systems it's a typedef.  The new code works
	  for both.

2005-08-23 23:25  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.73): Tweaking the GDAL install instructions a bit
	  more.

2005-08-23 23:04  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.72): Updating the GDAL install instructions.

2005-08-23 21:38  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.133): Changing the summary format slightly.  No
	  code changes.

2005-08-23 21:23  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.132): Drawing a line in the configure summary
	  between the normal and the more unusual parameters.

2005-08-23 21:18  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.131): Changing some text on the summary output.
	  No code changes.

2005-08-23 20:52  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.42): Add configure-time check for usability of
	  -Wno-unused-parameter. Older compilers (not newer as was indicated
	  in the comments) don't like that and need -Wno-unused instead.

	  Return -W to the CFLAGS, and use whatever -Wno-unused* works.

2005-08-23 19:30  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.41): Taking some of the new compiler flags back
	  out as one of them isn't recognized on some versions of GCC, and the
	  other causes too many warnings without it.  Hopefully we can add the
	  "-W" back in at a later date once we figure out how to get rid of
	  the "unused parameter" warnings on a case-by-case basis.

2005-08-22 22:21  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.40): Adding "-W" and "-Wno-unused_parameter"
	  compiler flags.  Still a clean compile with SuSE Linux 9.0.  No
	  errors, no warnings.

2005-08-22 18:35  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.10): Tweaking to match new format for
	  summary.log file (we only want to show the first line now).

2005-08-20 01:40  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.39): Adding more strict compiler checking.

2005-08-20 01:27  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.71): Adding notes about malloc debugging.

2005-08-19 18:33  tvrusso

	* configure.ac (1.130): Add probe for sighandler_t definition, and
	  code to work around it being missing.

2005-08-18 21:49  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.38): Make use of LIBS in the gdal probe without
	  gdal-config match the usage with gdal-config

	  fix bogon in awk_rule table in testawk.c

2005-08-17 18:59  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.70): Tweaking the libgc instructions.

2005-08-15 20:01  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.129): Adding a very short summary of the
	  configure tests and results to summary.log.  This should aid in
	  debugging as we can more quickly see what passed/failed on a
	  particular user's machine.

2005-08-13 16:43  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.124): Fixing a couple of typos.

2005-08-13 03:17  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.37), configure.ac (1.128): Taking out the new
	  MALLOC test added today as AC_FUNC_MALLOC already does what we need.

2005-08-12 21:37  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.36), configure.ac (1.127): Adding rpl_malloc()
	  function in util.c, and the associated hooks into acinclude.m4 and
	  configure.ac to get it called.  This is to replace malloc() for
	  those cases where malloc() doesn't behave properly.

2005-08-12 21:36  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.69): Adding a note about libgc's extra memory usage.

2005-08-11 19:46  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.9): Added a default configure/compile at the
	  end, both to test this case and to get the codebase back to normal
	  for the system it's run on.

2005-08-11 19:20  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.8): Removed a couple of el-stupido test
	  cases.  Nice'ed everything.

2005-08-11 01:37  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.126): Adding warnings so that library
	  dependencies are obvious.  Adding code so that missing dependencies
	  cause dependent libraries to be skipped.

2005-08-11 01:35  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.68): Added an ASCII-art drawing showing the library
	  dependencies.

2005-08-10 21:06  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.125): Adding another configure warning for
	  missing library.

2005-08-10 19:00  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.7): Adding tests for ALL libraries minus one,
	  each in turn.

2005-08-10 18:58  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.124): Forcing use_rtree to OFF and issuing a
	  warning if Shapelib is not being used.

2005-08-09 15:57  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.35): Fix for broken fix of broken fix of probe
	  for gdal.

	  After I fixed the multiply-included -lgdal issue and made sure that
	  I'd separated out -Ls from -ls, I never made sure that the -l got
	  into LIBS.  I was counting on AC_CHECK_LIB to do that, but it only
	  does so if you don't provide an ACTION-IF-FOUND.

2005-08-09 03:53  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.34): Add ugly hack to work around gdal-config's
	  idiosyncratic merging of LDFLAGS and LIBS data with the single
	  "gdal-config --libs" command.  Other programs with -config scripts
	  have --ldflags and --libs to keep the stuff separate.

2005-08-09 03:18  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.33): Fix broken attempt to replace old flags into
	  variables after failing test.

2005-08-06 18:11  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.32): Fix up AC_CHECK_GDAL so it uses LIBS instead
	  of LDFLAGS.  This makes it more consistent with other usages.
	  gdal-config --libs actuall returns both LDFLAGS and LIBS type
	  information, and using its output for LDFLAGS winds up putting the
	  -lgdal flag very early in the link line.  This could be a problem on
	  some systems.

2005-08-06 18:05  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.31): Fix dumb mistake in the section that handles
	  the "gdal-config not found" condition.

2005-08-06 18:01  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.30), configure.ac (1.123): Make probe for gdal
	  use gdal-config if it can be found.

	  If gdal-config is in the user's path, use it to get LDFLAGS and
	  CPPFLAGS to help the probe for gdal.h and libgdal.a.  Otherwise, use
	  the current settings of LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS and hope they're found.

	  In doing this, I think I see that the probe XASTIR_CHECK_IMAGEMAGICK
	  has a few bugs in it.

2005-08-06 01:14  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.6): Making the output a bit easier to
	  understand.

2005-08-03 19:15  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.5): More minor cleanups.  No real changes.

2005-08-02 20:22  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.4): Small tweaks to improve the output and
	  give us info while it is running instead of all the output at the
	  end.

2005-08-02 04:40  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.3): Changing the order of the individual flag
	  tests to match the summary output order from "configure".

2005-08-02 04:16  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.2): Fiximg the grep at the end.

2005-08-02 02:33  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.1): Initial checkin.  A "dumb" script the way
	  it is currently written, but it could be made much more intelligent
	  over time, and extended to perform more tests.

2005-08-01 19:43  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.122): Bumping version to 1.6.1 for further
	  development.

2005-08-01 17:54  we7u

2005-07-20 18:49  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.29): Adding some comments to the
	  XASTIR_BERKELEY_DB_CHK_LIB function.  Things we need to add/figure

	  successfully used with Xastir.

2005-07-20 04:41  we7u

	  substantial.

2005-07-15 16:18  we7u

2005-07-11 19:25  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.119): Fixing the Geotiff summary line so that it

	  terraserver so that we can use all four options available currently.
	  Put a bit more debugging code and parameter checking code into

	* README.MAPS (1.60): Implementing an "Auto" function in the Map
	  Properties dialog for polygon fills.  "Auto" will cause a dbfawk
	  file to be used, if it is present.  The "Yes" (On) and "No" (Off)
	  filled options that existed before will now override a dbfawk file,
	  so you can use a Shapefile map in three different ways now from the
	  Map Properties dialog.  I use this "No" option for instance to make
	  the NOAA Counties Shapefile into a vector map so I can overlay it on
	  top of a raster map, use the "Yes" function to use it as a base map
	  of the U.S., or use the "Auto" function to get all the advanced
	  per-object coloring possible from the dbfawk file, including county
	  names, border colors, etc.

	  The default setting for new Shapefiles will be "Auto".  Default for
	  all other types of maps will be "No" or "Off".

	* DEBUG_LEVELS (1.10): Several improvements of ALOHA reporting, as
	  discussed on xastir-dev

	  1) Change #ifdef DEBUG_ALOHA to a debug level test (2048)
	  2) Add periodic display of ALOHA range in status line
	  3) Add a "View->ALOHA Statistics" menu option.  Pops up a dialog
	     with ALOHA range, number of stations in ALOHA circle, count of

	* acinclude.m4 (1.25): Fix of fix for fix of fix of probe for db
	  library.

	  Amounts to removing a comment character from a critical line that
	  I'd accidentally commented out.

	  Without this fix, building xastir on a machine without a db library
	  installed will fail with an error message at link stage about a
	  missing "-ldb".  That's because the configure script never reset the
	  LIBS variable after the probe.

2004-11-14 01:10  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.24):

	  Handful of changes to improve probe of db for map caching.

	  1) remove attempts to probe db version 3 libraries, coz the code
	     that uses db actually won't work unless the version is 4 or above.

	  2) make the probe stop probing when it finds a library that works.
	     Otherwise the probe keeps overwriting the "dblib" variable with
	  "no".

	  3) comment out the attempt to probe for db_open if db_create isn't
	     found.  That would only work if the code that uses db_create were
	     inside appropriate ifdefs, which was probably the case in the
	     package from which the autoconf macro was obtained.

	  4) Change the comment about "FreeBSD puts this in a weird place"
	     enough to give a reader an idea of where to look.

2004-11-14 00:12  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.23), configure.ac (1.105): A minor tweak to add

	  Now, if a dbfawk file sets filled=1, fill_style=2, and
	  fill_stipple={0,1,2}, the filled polygons will be stippled instead
	  of solid.

	  fill_stipple=0 gives 13% stipple fill_stipple=1 gives 25% stipple
	  fill_stipple=2 gives 50% stipple.

	  "fill_style=2" corresponds to FillStippled per XSetFillStyle.

	* Makefile.am (1.28): Return "dist-bzip2" to the AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS
	  variable.

	  it is true that --dist-bzip2 is not a valid automake option, but the
	  AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS variable doesn't generate --options for automake,
	  it has an effect on the generated makefile itself.  In this case,
	  dist-bzip2 adds a dist-bzip2 target to the makefile.

	  As far as I can tell, the folks who are having trouble with this
	  option are not in fact using automake 1.6.3 or later.  In ha2vr's
	  case it turned out he was actually using automake 1.4, even though
	  automake 1.9 was supposedly installed on his system.

2004-09-27 00:29  tvrusso

	* Makefile.am (1.27), acinclude.m4 (1.18), bootstrap.sh (1.8): Per

	   -  remove "dist-bzip2" from "AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS" in Makefile.am.
	   -  Fix underquoted AC_DEFUN of AC_CHECK_GMTOFF

	  Also, add a print statement to end of "bootstrap.sh" so it's clear
	  when it's finished successfully.

2004-09-19 23:39  tvrusso

	* README.MAPS (1.41): This is a patch I've been using for several
	  months now: it allows xastir to use geotiff files that are already
	  unprojected lat/lon maps.  It simply checks the "PCS" key in the
	  geotif file, and if it's not there then the file is assumed to be in
	  lat/lon and can be used as is without transformation.

	  It has no effect on maps that are not already in lat/lon, and so
	  will be invisible to anyone who hasn't needed the ability to read in
	  unprojected geotiff files.

	  README.MAPS updated to explain that gdalwarp can be used to convert
	  maps into lat/lon unprojected maps.  Also added a place to find
	  useful geotiff maps that need such conversion (FAA sectionals from
	  aviationtoolbox.org).

	  Tweaked the stuff on shapefile reprojection.  What was there were
	  verbose snippets from an email exchange between Curt and me.  Made
	  them a bit shorter and more to-the-point.

	  The importing of lat/lon geotiff files is significantly slower than
	  the importing of USGS quads, because the optimized reads that skip
	  over scanlines based on zoom level don't work.  I intended to figure
	  out how to make them work, but never did the work.  If folks start
	  using this a lot and get me to bump it up in priority I can revisit
	  it.

	* FAQ (1.23): Simplified the all interfaces up/down logic.  It
	  should work better now.  Changed the config file backup code so that
	  xastir.cnf.1 through xastir.cnf.3 are created.  This should help
	  insulate us a bit better from crashes, as we'll have more old copies
	  of the config file to draw from if the main config file (xastir.cnf)
	  gets trashed.

2004-01-15 16:56  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.75): Adding a line in for getting rid of
	  duplicates in the LIBS variable.  Commented out while testing so

2003-12-02 23:06  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.71): Broke libproj check out into its own section
	  and summary line.  We still need it checked in the libgeotiff
	  section as well though, as we depend on proj there too.

2003-12-02 21:50  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.70): Moving the pcre summary next to the dbfawk
	  summary at the end of configure.  Reordered some of the rest as
	  well, putting all of the map libraries together.

2003-12-01 20:56  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.22): Removing a note that is no longer needed.  CVS
	  GDAL has been tweaked to fix it.

2003-11-26 20:04  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.21): Adding GDAL instructions (not that there's much
	  that can be done with it yet, but it's still nice to see the future
	  list of supported map formats on startup!).

2003-11-16 23:33  we7u

	  limitations of shpproj.

2003-11-12 21:23  we7u

2003-10-17 09:13  we7u

	* bootstrap.sh (1.5): Added a line to remove the autom4te.cache
	  directory and contents.  This sometimes gets in the way when running
	  autoheader, and I have to delete it manually in that case.  No more.

2003-10-16 21:44  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.68): Moving the GDAL stuff after shapelib and
	  libgeotiff.  We want GDAL to get linked AFTER the other libraries,
	  at least until we get GDAL fully integrated.  If GDAL is linked
	  earlier than these other libraries, function calls get made to GDAL
	  instead of the correct libraries.

2003-10-16 16:07  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.67): More initial framework for GDAL integration.
	  Now adds it to the list of supported libraries in "configure", and
	  adds the library to the link line.

	  file tags.

	  enabling map-specific special cases.

2003-09-02 23:43  jtwilley

	* configure.ac (1.64): Moved AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE and added arguments.

	  Added documentation for AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE.

2003-07-18 20:52  jtwilley

	* acinclude.m4 (1.11): Wrapped gcc-specific tests in an if test for
	  gcc.  Added -Wall to CFLAGS when using gcc.

2003-07-18 20:15  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.61): Adding "-Wall" to CFLAGS.  Not sure if this
	  is the perfect way to get it included into src/Makefile, but this

2003-07-18 02:29  n2ygk

	  xastir.cnf references to those shared files.
