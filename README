     (0) NOTICE

          Please read this file carefully before trying to set up Xastir.
          This software was developed to be used by licensced amature radio
          operators.  You are responsible for any information transmitted
          or propogated on any network.

     (1) WHAT IS XASTIR?


     (2) HOW TO GET XASTIR

          Currently, the 1.0.x tree of xastir is developed at xastir.org.
          You can get the latest version of xastir from
          ftp://argon.hscs.virginia.edu/pub/xastir

          You might try www.xastir.org for help and information.


     (2a) CVS USAGE

          You might obtain the *very latest* version of xastir that
          is still under development by using CVS. CVS means
          'Concurrent Versions System' and is a tool for developers to
          always keep source code up to date. Try 'man cvs' on your
          shell for more information about CVS ;-)

          This intended only for users that know a fair bit about
          xastir. Be aware that the versions of xastir that you get
          by CVS are still being developed, and may be buggy. The
          Xastir devteam will in *NO WAY* take any responsibility for
          whatever might happen to you or your computer if you use a
          CVS version of xastir.

          To obtain xastir over CVS, do as follows:

               (1) log into your shell
               (2) type 'export
               CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@argon.hscs.virginia.edu:/usr/local/cvs'

               (3) type 'cvs login'
               (4) type 'xastir' when it asks for a password.
               (5) in your home dir, type 'cvs checkout xastir'
               (6) in ~/xastir, you should have a copy of the
               latest CVS version of xastir.

          Notes:

               (1) you can 'cvs logout', but you don't need to.
               (2) you don't need to go through this whole
               process every time; if you want to get a CVS
               version of xastir at a later time, you can just
               'cd ~/xastir' and type 'cvs update -A'.
               (3) if you experience errors when using 'export',
               you might be using tclsh as a shell. If so, try
               using the command 'setenv' instead of 'export':
               'setenv CVSROOT
               :pserver:anonymous@argon.hscs.virginia.edu:/usr/local/cvs'

     (3) QUICK STARTUP

         #### NOW INCLUDED IN 'INSTALL' - READ IT *AFTER* FINISHING THIS ####

     (4) UPGRADING

     (6) MAILING LIST

          There are currently a couple of mailing lists about xastir.
          xastir@xastir.org is the one relevant for posts about
          xastir 0.4.0 and up (and bug fixes, and suggestions, etc).

          To subscribe to the xastir mailing list, send email to:
          xastir-request@xastir.org In the body of the message,
          put "subscribe xastir"; or go to
          http://www.xastir.org/mailman/listinfo/xastir

               ### DO NOT SEND FRANK EMAIL ABOUT XASTIR ###

          Frank is no longer developing the xastir code (although
          he does put a word in every now and then) so don't bother
          emailing him. If you have a serious problem, email the
          xastir mailing list and it will get to the coders.

          Please, before posting to this list, see what things are
          like, and when you do post, read over your post for
          readability, spelling, and grammar mistakes. Obviously,
          we're all human (or are we?) and we all make mistakes (heck,
          look at this document! ;).

          Open discussion and debate is integral to change and
          progress. Don't flame others over mere form (grammar and
          spelling), or even substantive issues either for that
          matter. Please read and follow the mailing list rules.

          The xastir@xastir.org maillist is dedicated to Bug
          reports, technical questions, your thoughts or
          suggestions on new features being added to Xastir, things
          that should be removed or fixed, amazing problems that even
          stump the guru's, etc... are what we want to see here.

     (7) DOCUMENTATION

          We're trying to keep the documentation up to date. If you
          feel that anything is missing here, or that anything should
          be added etc, please email xastir@xastir.org about it,
          thank you.
